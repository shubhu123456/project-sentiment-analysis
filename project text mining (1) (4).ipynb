       "['Even the best devices can be ruined by poor software and bad UI. This is a classic case of a good device such as the Echo dot 3rd gen let down by horrendous software. In terms of sheer sound quality and ability to hear you across the room, the ED 3rd blows google home mini right out of the water, and... that\\'s where it stops.I bought it for 2299 and got a wipro bulb free, I figured that it couldn\\'t be a bad purchase. Boy was I wrong!Let\\'s begin with the Alexa app, whoever is in charge of making that app should be sent back to 2012. Remember when you had no clue whether you tapped on a button or not because the taps weren\\'t highlighted? Remember how everything used to be unresponsive back then? Yeah, that\\'s Alexa app for you. SD 855 and 8gigs of ram on your phone? LoL, Alexa don\\'t care! The layout, the buttons in the app, the navigation, ugh.. takes me back to the 90\\'s. A big zero on ease of use or navigational hierarchy. Forget Grandpa, even millennials would have a hard time with this app!What about voice recognition? 50% of the time, it does not recognize you every time.Smartness: The lack of smartness is displayed when you start asking follow up questions. \"Who is the tallest man?\" It\\'ll give you the answer, but if you follow up with \"how tall is he?\". Alexa will go berserk. Heralding a device that can control your lights or turn on the TV as a miraculous achievement is a blatant lie. Controls via commands is nothing new, people in the coding community have done so with raspberry pi\\'s before. What makes it smart is the incousion of AI and machine learning that understands patters and recognizes speech slurs. Something google does and constantly thrives to improve upon.Microphones: There are 4 and they are good, they can hear you from 10 feet away under normal circumstances. Far better than Goggle home mini.Connectivity issues: Wuff, this is one of the biggest issues I faced. Connection is not as easy and simple as that 3 slide image says on the description. Turn on Bluetooth, location, wifi, then look at the app for a Echo-something-th8, it didn\\'t show up! Great, now do the manual labour and get it connected. Even after connection you\\'re gonna get \"updating your device for 10 minutes\".Integration with other smart devices: Wanna connect the wipro bulb with Alexa? First download the wipro smart home app, create an account so that you can be spammed for the rest of your life, then set up that app and device. Next, head over to Alexa, download the wipro skill app for alexa, set it up and congratulations, you can now control lights with latency issues rivaling that of a 56k modem. What\\'s worse, I now have an app on my phone that I only used once in my life but cannot for the love of god uninstall because that stops the bulb from working. VERY SMART!Music: Wanna listen to music on this speaker from your favorite streaming service? Unless it\\'s Amazon music, Saavn or iTunes, your sh!t our of luck. Even though Spotify launched nearly a year ago, there\\'s no way to get Spotify playing on the device natively unless you change device region to Amerika.Speed: You can stream Netflix at 4k? That\\'s great, Alexa don\\'t care! Ask a question, go brew a coffee, fix that leaking faucet, sign up for a banking loan and then, only then perhaps you would get your answer. Now that\\'s an exaggeration but when you compare Alexa\\'s speed in terms of genuine questions as opposed to responding to commands like \"turn off the light\", it is the slowest. Google>Siri>Cortana>your neighbor\\'s pigeon >Alexa.I could go on, but I\\'ll stop here and sulk myself with buyer\\'s remorse.',\n",
       " 'I purchased this as a birthday gift for my 7 years old son. Since he don\\'t have siblings so I though it would be a fun experience for him talking to and giving commands to alexa. But to my dismay he only used it for playing music that also only one song after one month of his birthday. \"Alexa please play the flying jat song\". There were things I demonstrated him about alexa like jungle quiz, panchtantra ki kahaniya, alexa laugh, beatbox, fart!  Etc. But after one month of use he lost interest in it and being powered from socket I am also not interested to use it as a bluetooth speaker. I configured it to control a wipro smart bulb. But after few days  I started using the smart bulb as a regular bulb because it\\'s easier to press the physical switch compared to checking the configuration & connection everytime \"Alexa Bulb on\" or \"Alexa bulb off\" voice command doesn\\'t work. So now it is kept idle since 3 months and will remain so for many more months/years to come. The bottomline is that alexa is not that useful as advertised and we tend to lose interest in it very quickly.',\n",

       " \"Before buying this product please keep these points in mind:- You need amazon prime account  for Rs. 999 per year to listen to music from amazon. Otherwise you will have to use free and full of advertisement services like Saavn, Gaana, etc.- Echo dot skips to next song abruptly without completing current song most often.- If you try to stream music from your Amazon Prime Music app on your iPhone to Echo Dot or Echo Dot stereo pair, the app cannot control the music. You cannot scrub music or know which song is playing or move to next music in the playlist. The control magically switches the Alexa app that you need to have on your phone to setup Echo dot.- You can only stream to stereo pair from Amazon Prime Music App.- No real support exists for this device. If you call amazon support staff, they will drive you crazy as they know nothing about this product and its features.- If you want to use it as kids toy, then it is ok to buy it as it can switch on and off lights that are compatible with Alexa.- Audio quality is very basic. Even a cheap Chinese product sounds better.- This is really a no no product for music lovers. You better buy either Sony or JBL soundbars with subwoofer for better quality music, though these may cost you beyond INR15k.- Alexa does not understands most of the commands. Apple Siri is way ahead of Alexa.- Amazon is not a software and hardware company. Don't expect quality software  and hardware from them. You are being used as testers for their experimental products.\",\n",

So no more asking friends to get them from there!!!!  Anyone sitting on the fence can buy this instead of buying bluetooth speakers.  This is 5th Echo dot including earlier versions and Google Mini doesnt even come close when it comes to smartness.  While Google mini answers google search questions better - no one is buying a smart speaker for that.  Its integration with smart devices is unparalled and my mini appears dumb most of the times.  Just grab this before it goes back to its old price.  Even the smart bulb is very helpful.  While watching TV..just ask Alexa to turn bulb blue or red!!

Very responsive to voice command in comparison to 4th Gen.2. Only 1-1.5 scale down from 4th Gen in sound and bass quality.3. I prefer 3rd Gen hockey puck design than 4th Gen round shape (personal preference).4. For higher audio quality and output one can always use external speakers via aux cable.5. Can integrate with Google even via bluetooth.6. Easy to place anywhere without any scope of rolling off.7. LED ring light looks distinctive on top than bottom (4th Gen) bcoz one can't see its 360° view.8. Plays soft music prity well than hard.9. Can fit into confined space.10.

Most of the times you get fed up with the results and then switch off the device.

This has communication features so people having alexa app or echo device and permission can actually call you on your echo dot.2. This has announcement features so if you are late for dinner you can announce that on your echo device from your phone.(Actually i use this feature to play ghost sounds when little kids are in my room😝)3. This has best features for home automations that google home or any other devices don't have.4. This has best features for timer tasks.5. Scheduling is much more advanced in alexa app.6. If you say turn on light in front of your kitchen echo dot it will turn on only kitchen lights. so you don't have to be specific like turn on kitchen lights like google home.(you need multiple echo devices for this as obvious)So forgot about google home and just buy it.\",\n",

After having my device for nearly 5 months , I was sent a redicolous high estimate for repair which costs as much as a  new device itself. Not only that , the email coatation is for a fire stick when I sent them an echo dot device. Again no clarification received from them till date even though I have sent a second reminder.My reason to go into such details is that one should never waste ones time with CTDI and what is even more shocking is AMAZON'S attitude once your device is out of warranty.AMAZON arrogantly washes their hands of you and your problem .\",\n",

In google I have to shout (not loud but still enough) in echo I can just whisper, and it responds every single time.  The second thing is during switching off or switching on the light ,  google repeat the full name of my light for example it shouts ” switching on Nikhil Syska bulb” during night if you have forgotten to lower the volume suddenly you will call google “ switch of the light “ it will shout back “ switching off Nikhil Syska bulb “ but echo dot just say “ok” which way more convenient.Though when it comes to connecting to laptop automatically the scenario is totally opposite , google connects silently just making a ping sound and echo repeats my lappy name.The other thing is buttons in place of touch . I like buttons in place of touch , which make its tough to pick the google , most of the time either it play/ pause the songs or increase / decrease the volume . If I have voice assistance, why would I need touch 🙄.Alexa integration- because I use amazon shoping and I have kindle , the integration is very much useful for me . My echo reads my book for me .

Sometime I have scream, You feel like better Google kar leta kaha Alexa ko bola diya. 😀3. Music - When you say play 90s songs, it starts with same set and sequence of songs. Boring.4. Every time we have keep for charging.5. After Wipro smart bulb price deduction, effectively Alexa cost me 1700/-, but won't feel worth.

They told me to purchase the same new device since it's a COVID pandemic, so I agreed and bought a new device, and when the device delivered to me after 4 days it was also having the same issue as the previous one, so I called in Amazon help services and registered a complaint, they told me to pair another mobile through Bluetooth so I paired during the phone call to Amazon helpline and played something on it, then it was working perfectly alright, but when I played through the new paired mobile on next day the sound was distorted.I recommend not to buy this device.\",\n",

Talking about the 4 mics integrated in the device. These mics works just awesome, it does not matter how loud the music is or how far you are from alexa in a room, all you have to do is say “Alexa” and she activates. The best part is it does not matter how much noise in the environment, she can hear you. Echo dot can be easily linked to other devices.It also works with almost all the smart home devices.( smart bulbs, hubs, microwave, etc)*Note: Echo dot requires a high-speed wifi connection (more than 20Mbps) for better experience.

       "['Even the best devices can be ruined by poor software and bad UI. This is a classic case of a good device such as the Echo dot 3rd gen let down by horrendous software. In terms of sheer sound quality and ability to hear you across the room, the ED 3rd blows google home mini right out of the water, and... that\\'s where it stops.I bought it for 2299 and got a wipro bulb free, I figured that it couldn\\'t be a bad purchase. Boy was I wrong!Let\\'s begin with the Alexa app, whoever is in charge of making that app should be sent back to 2012. Remember when you had no clue whether you tapped on a button or not because the taps weren\\'t highlighted? Remember how everything used to be unresponsive back then? Yeah, that\\'s Alexa app for you. SD 855 and 8gigs of ram on your phone? LoL, Alexa don\\'t care! The layout, the buttons in the app, the navigation, ugh.. takes me back to the 90\\'s. A big zero on ease of use or navigational hierarchy. Forget Grandpa, even millennials would have a hard time with this app!What about voice recognition? 50% of the time, it does not recognize you every time.Smartness: The lack of smartness is displayed when you start asking follow up questions. \"Who is the tallest man?\" It\\'ll give you the answer, but if you follow up with \"how tall is he?\". Alexa will go berserk. Heralding a device that can control your lights or turn on the TV as a miraculous achievement is a blatant lie. Controls via commands is nothing new, people in the coding community have done so with raspberry pi\\'s before. What makes it smart is the incousion of AI and machine learning that understands patters and recognizes speech slurs. Something google does and constantly thrives to improve upon.Microphones: There are 4 and they are good, they can hear you from 10 feet away under normal circumstances. Far better than Goggle home mini.Connectivity issues: Wuff, this is one of the biggest issues I faced. Connection is not as easy and simple as that 3 slide image says on the description. Turn on Bluetooth, location, wifi, then look at the app for a Echo-something-th8, it didn\\'t show up! Great, now do the manual labour and get it connected. Even after connection you\\'re gonna get \"updating your device for 10 minutes\".Integration with other smart devices: Wanna connect the wipro bulb with Alexa? First download the wipro smart home app, create an account so that you can be spammed for the rest of your life, then set up that app and device. Next, head over to Alexa, download the wipro skill app for alexa, set it up and congratulations, you can now control lights with latency issues rivaling that of a 56k modem. What\\'s worse, I now have an app on my phone that I only used once in my life but cannot for the love of god uninstall because that stops the bulb from working. VERY SMART!Music: Wanna listen to music on this speaker from your favorite streaming service? Unless it\\'s Amazon music, Saavn or iTunes, your sh!t our of luck. Even though Spotify launched nearly a year ago, there\\'s no way to get Spotify playing on the device natively unless you change device region to Amerika.Speed: You can stream Netflix at 4k? That\\'s great, Alexa don\\'t care! Ask a question, go brew a coffee, fix that leaking faucet, sign up for a banking loan and then, only then perhaps you would get your answer. Now that\\'s an exaggeration but when you compare Alexa\\'s speed in terms of genuine questions as opposed to responding to commands like \"turn off the light\", it is the slowest. Google>Siri>Cortana>your neighbor\\'s pigeon >Alexa.I could go on, but I\\'ll stop here and sulk myself with buyer\\'s remorse.',\n",
       " 'I purchased this as a birthday gift for my 7 years old son. Since he don\\'t have siblings so I though it would be a fun experience for him talking to and giving commands to alexa. But to my dismay he only used it for playing music that also only one song after one month of his birthday. \"Alexa please play the flying jat song\". There were things I demonstrated him about alexa like jungle quiz, panchtantra ki kahaniya, alexa laugh, beatbox, fart!  Etc. But after one month of use he lost interest in it and being powered from socket I am also not interested to use it as a bluetooth speaker. I configured it to control a wipro smart bulb. But after few days  I started using the smart bulb as a regular bulb because it\\'s easier to press the physical switch compared to checking the configuration & connection everytime \"Alexa Bulb on\" or \"Alexa bulb off\" voice command doesn\\'t work. So now it is kept idle since 3 months and will remain so for many more months/years to come. The bottomline is that alexa is not that useful as advertised and we tend to lose interest in it very quickly.',\n",

       " \"Before buying this product please keep these points in mind:- You need amazon prime account  for Rs. 999 per year to listen to music from amazon. Otherwise you will have to use free and full of advertisement services like Saavn, Gaana, etc.- Echo dot skips to next song abruptly without completing current song most often.- If you try to stream music from your Amazon Prime Music app on your iPhone to Echo Dot or Echo Dot stereo pair, the app cannot control the music. You cannot scrub music or know which song is playing or move to next music in the playlist. The control magically switches the Alexa app that you need to have on your phone to setup Echo dot.- You can only stream to stereo pair from Amazon Prime Music App.- No real support exists for this device. If you call amazon support staff, they will drive you crazy as they know nothing about this product and its features.- If you want to use it as kids toy, then it is ok to buy it as it can switch on and off lights that are compatible with Alexa.- Audio quality is very basic. Even a cheap Chinese product sounds better.- This is really a no no product for music lovers. You better buy either Sony or JBL soundbars with subwoofer for better quality music, though these may cost you beyond INR15k.- Alexa does not understands most of the commands. Apple Siri is way ahead of Alexa.- Amazon is not a software and hardware company. Don't expect quality software  and hardware from them. You are being used as testers for their experimental products.\",\n",

I prefer 3rd Gen hockey puck design than 4th Gen round shape (personal preference).4. For higher audio quality and output one can always use external speakers via aux cable.5. Can integrate with Google even via bluetooth.6. Easy to place anywhere without any scope of rolling off.7. LED ring light looks distinctive on top than bottom (4th Gen) bcoz one can't see its 360° view.8. Plays soft music prity well than hard.9. Can fit into confined space.10.

This is only a part of the home automation system. All the smart equipment/products you purchase can be connected with Alexa like a light bulb to control it with voice etc. but for that, you need a router in your home.ConclusionThe speaker does not have a battery but he can be connected via Bluetooth from your phone and PC. Which is a good thing but all of a sudden it stops playing for no reason which is very annoying?I got it in INR 2500, at this price you must buy it, just to experience a smart speaker but in INR 3500 it looks a bit expansive. If you decide to buy this then this going to be the first step to transform your home into a smart home.',\n",

In google I have to shout (not loud but still enough) in echo I can just whisper, and it responds every single time.  The second thing is during switching off or switching on the light ,  google repeat the full name of my light for example it shouts ” switching on Nikhil Syska bulb” during night if you have forgotten to lower the volume suddenly you will call google “ switch of the light “ it will shout back “ switching off Nikhil Syska bulb “ but echo dot just say “ok” which way more convenient.Though when it comes to connecting to laptop automatically the scenario is totally opposite , google connects silently just making a ping sound and echo repeats my lappy name.The other thing is buttons in place of touch . I like buttons in place of touch , which make its tough to pick the google , most of the time either it play/ pause the songs or increase / decrease the volume . If I have voice assistance, why would I need touch 🙄.Alexa integration- because I use amazon shoping and I have kindle , the integration is very much useful for me . My echo reads my book for me .

Sometimes I am amazed by how well it picks up stuff.6. Kids love it. An added advantage is that they can take help for homework and talking to alexa also motivates them to talk in English.7.

       "'Even the best devices can be ruined by poor software and bad UI. This is a classic case of a good device such as the Echo dot 3rd gen let down by horrendous software. In terms of sheer sound quality and ability to hear you across the room, the ED 3rd blows google home mini right out of the water, and... that\\'s where it stops.I bought it for 2299 and got a wipro bulb free, I figured that it couldn\\'t be a bad purchase. Boy was I wrong!Let\\'s begin with the Alexa app, whoever is in charge of making that app should be sent back to 2012. Remember when you had no clue whether you tapped on a button or not because the taps weren\\'t highlighted? Remember how everything used to be unresponsive back then? Yeah, that\\'s Alexa app for you. SD 855 and 8gigs of ram on your phone? LoL, Alexa don\\'t care! The layout, the buttons in the app, the navigation, ugh.. takes me back to the 90\\'s. A big zero on ease of use or navigational hierarchy. Forget Grandpa, even millennials would have a hard time with this app!What about voice recognition? 50% of the time, it does not recognize you every time.Smartness: The lack of smartness is displayed when you start asking follow up questions. \"Who is the tallest man?\" It\\'ll give you the answer, but if you follow up with \"how tall is he?\". Alexa will go berserk. Heralding a device that can control your lights or turn on the TV as a miraculous achievement is a blatant lie. Controls via commands is nothing new, people in the coding community have done so with raspberry pi\\'s before. What makes it smart is the incousion of AI and machine learning that understands patters and recognizes speech slurs. Something google does and constantly thrives to improve upon.Microphones: There are 4 and they are good, they can hear you from 10 feet away under normal circumstances. Far better than Goggle home mini.Connectivity issues: Wuff, this is one of the biggest issues I faced. Connection is not as easy and simple as that 3 slide image says on the description. Turn on Bluetooth, location, wifi, then look at the app for a Echo-something-th8, it didn\\'t show up! Great, now do the manual labour and get it connected. Even after connection you\\'re gonna get \"updating your device for 10 minutes\".Integration with other smart devices: Wanna connect the wipro bulb with Alexa? First download the wipro smart home app, create an account so that you can be spammed for the rest of your life, then set up that app and device. Next, head over to Alexa, download the wipro skill app for alexa, set it up and congratulations, you can now control lights with latency issues rivaling that of a 56k modem. What\\'s worse, I now have an app on my phone that I only used once in my life but cannot for the love of god uninstall because that stops the bulb from working. VERY SMART!Music: Wanna listen to music on this speaker from your favorite streaming service? Unless it\\'s Amazon music, Saavn or iTunes, your sh!t our of luck. Even though Spotify launched nearly a year ago, there\\'s no way to get Spotify playing on the device natively unless you change device region to Amerika.Speed: You can stream Netflix at 4k? That\\'s great, Alexa don\\'t care! Ask a question, go brew a coffee, fix that leaking faucet, sign up for a banking loan and then, only then perhaps you would get your answer. Now that\\'s an exaggeration but when you compare Alexa\\'s speed in terms of genuine questions as opposed to responding to commands like \"turn off the light\", it is the slowest. Google>Siri>Cortana>your neighbor\\'s pigeon >Alexa.I could go on, but I\\'ll stop here and sulk myself with buyer\\'s remorse.I purchased this as a birthday gift for my 7 years old son. Since he don\\'t have siblings so I though it would be a fun experience for him talking to and giving commands to alexa. But to my dismay he only used it for playing music that also only one song after one month of his birthday. \"Alexa please play the flying jat song\". There were things I demonstrated him about alexa like jungle quiz, panchtantra ki kahaniya, alexa laugh, beatbox, fart!  Etc. But after one month of use he lost interest in it and being powered from socket I am also not interested to use it as a bluetooth speaker. I configured it to control a wipro smart bulb. But after few days  I started using the smart bulb as a regular bulb because it\\'s easier to press the physical switch compared to checking the configuration & connection everytime \"Alexa Bulb on\" or \"Alexa bulb off\" voice command doesn\\'t work. So now it is kept idle since 3 months and will remain so for many more months/years to come. The bottomline is that alexa is not that useful as advertised and we tend to lose interest in it very quickly.The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n/*Here I\\'m Uploading video, enjoy*/Most idiotic device I every bought, never play original songs. Always play some or the other remix or instrumental songs.I wish I would have bought Google home or some Bluetooth speakers./*Some attachments after talking to Amazon Echo Dot Executive*/After my above review, Echo Dot representative called me, I\\'m glad for this.I showed him the issue with song selection but he told me that it is because of library doesn\\'t have songs that I\\'m selecting and it is better to add gaana.com from alexa app, after following his guidelines, I repeated and recorded issues. Please see the screen shots and listed to audio  for Alexa and have fun (Now I realise amazon review doen\\'t support audio but only video).You can buy this device if you have to have personalised fun in your life. The is not way of attaching Audio files only video so this is again funny, if I wan\\'t to attach some feedback for Alexa why do I need Video :). This is called mismatch in basic requirement.I\\'ll try to get capture view than attach here for same issues added as image. Till than enjoy.Its just one if the best deal i ever got on amazon I purchased it with a 12 watt wipro light at 2200 and enjoying it since last 2 daya its my 4th echo device and yes I would highly recommend buying a product with this just search echo dot wall mount you ll see a 800-900 rupees wall mount trust me it will make a huge difference between sound and transportability plus when its on wall if will recognise your voice quicker as it faces you on the wall seriously guys the combination of these two is compulsoryBefore buying this product please keep these points in mind:- You need amazon prime account  for Rs. 999 per year to listen to music from amazon. Otherwise you will have to use free and full of advertisement services like Saavn, Gaana, etc.- Echo dot skips to next song abruptly without completing current song most often.- If you try to stream music from your Amazon Prime Music app on your iPhone to Echo Dot or Echo Dot stereo pair, the app cannot control the music. You cannot scrub music or know which song is playing or move to next music in the playlist. The control magically switches the Alexa app that you need to have on your phone to setup Echo dot.- You can only stream to stereo pair from Amazon Prime Music App.- No real support exists for this device. If you call amazon support staff, they will drive you crazy as they know nothing about this product and its features.- If you want to use it as kids toy, then it is ok to buy it as it can switch on and off lights that are compatible with Alexa.- Audio quality is very basic. Even a cheap Chinese product sounds better.- This is really a no no product for music lovers. You better buy either Sony or JBL soundbars with subwoofer for better quality music, though these may cost you beyond INR15k.- Alexa does not understands most of the commands. Apple Siri is way ahead of Alexa.- Amazon is not a software and hardware company. Don\\'t expect quality software  and hardware from them. You are being used as testers for their experimental products.The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0Worst experience with alexa no warranty you get with this product.Amazon policy are worst. Ctdi partner an official amazon devices service partner.I have requested to Amazon to replace my alexa device with in the warranty period the refuses my request. issue is escalated bu amazon team but no follow up call can be held till today. They are giving fake excuses for service they are temporary un available for service of alexa after few days the warranty get to expire then they say your product warranty has expired so we did not give you a service for your product. “ excuse me amazon all of the world wide companies change their policies in national lockdown.” I think amazon policy are worst. They stand in the last of the top companies list. They have no customer satisfaction. Even apple has extended there warranty of their product in lockdown. Amazon shame Amazon shameful for youI am using alexa dot 2nd Gen and today I have gifted dot 3rd Gen to my Daddy.1. I see of difference in sound quality compared 2nd gen. Sound quality is amazing.2. It is louder than 2nd Gen Dot3. One thing disappointed is that when say \\'Alexa, play old telugu songs\\' in 2nd Gen Dot it Play old songs from retro station but in 3rd gen Dot it is playing telugu songs\\'(not telugu old songs). When I specially say \\'Alexa play telugu retro station songs\\' it is playing old songs of specific combination of male and female singers.I will update the review after days again but it\\'s 5 star rating for nowFor 2000 using 10% off..you are getting a bulb worth 500...making echo dot 1500 which at roughly 20 dollars is same price you get in deals in USA.  So no more asking friends to get them from there!!!!  Anyone sitting on the fence can buy this instead of buying bluetooth speakers.  This is 5th Echo dot including earlier versions and Google Mini doesnt even come close when it comes to smartness.  While Google mini answers google search questions better - no one is buying a smart speaker for that.  Its integration with smart devices is unparalled and my mini appears dumb most of the times.  Just grab this before it goes back to its old price.  Even the smart bulb is very helpful.  While watching TV..just ask Alexa to turn bulb blue or red!! Not sure if this bulb can dim...if so..you can use this both as a day bulb and a night bulb.  Just go for it before its too lateI was quite confused between echo dot 3rd & 4th Gen so bought both to try and after testing, I choose 3rd Gen bcoz of following reasons.1. Very responsive to voice command in comparison to 4th Gen.2. Only 1-1.5 scale down from 4th Gen in sound and bass quality.3. I prefer 3rd Gen hockey puck design than 4th Gen round shape (personal preference).4. For higher audio quality and output one can always use external speakers via aux cable.5. Can integrate with Google even via bluetooth.6. Easy to place anywhere without any scope of rolling off.7. LED ring light looks distinctive on top than bottom (4th Gen) bcoz one can\\'t see its 360° view.8. Plays soft music prity well than hard.9. Can fit into confined space.10. Also paid only ₹1999.What more one can ask for.The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0Do not buy this product. When i asked alexa that kashmir is part of which country it said china.Boycott alexaThe media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0Sound quality is good,fast response,easy to use.it is a good product and for those who are not much aware about the technology they can also operate easily.you can listen news and if you are feeling bored alexa can tell you good jokes.i m also using wipro smart bulb with Alexa and it is working awesome.i found only one issue sometimes alexa does not respond I think because when we give command from long distance I mean because of mic but overall good product.Sidhi si bat he iska pure use to sirf jo total sirf computer job vale hi kar shakte he baki to sab sholh k liye lete he,baki normal speakers ki tarah hi use hoga sound limited he ek room k hisab se, baki special search nahi karta kuchh only Amazon, Amazon prime music ,hungama,jese 3 se 5 platforms ko hi use karta he,baki puchho ge to javab milega iske bare me mobile app m jaye ,bss baki shokh pura karo baki naya kuchh nahi lagegaThis is useless device.0) it is not listening command properly. And we have to speak loudly.1) It is not connecting through Bluetooth to desktop. After a long research and hard setting it is connected and if we would change any song than audio is not coming. I am frustrated.2) Always need connectivity with internet / Bluetooth to operate any device.3) not playing music easily wherever we want.4) don\\'t waste money if don\\'t have 24 hours internet connection and related smart device.5) from desktop PC it is not connecting from cable and even from Bluetooth adaptor.So please please don\\'t waste your money on it.Not a smart device it is useless device.Bad software! Alexa is not smart at all.voice recognition is not accurate most of the times but more than that Alexa interpretation leaves lot to be desired. Alexa is a just NLP and works on plain if else or a switch condition rather than being smart device. No where follows the user pattens, voice patterns and the people to come up with suggestions. Most of the times you get fed up with the results and then switch off the device. Mostly none of the songs I want will be played, I end up using it for casting the music from the phone, which anyways normal Bluetooth speaker will do at a less price.Hardly any useful tricks as they call it!Just works as voice command based device rather than a smart speaker!I got a discount of 1000 for this product during some flash sale and got the product at Rs. 2499. It originally costs 3499. So to buy at this price is a awesome deal. I really appreciate amazon for selling products cheaper than the original cost. These are very friendly and reliable devices that can help you to track any orders or set up an alarm or sing a song on any occasion. Every thing I tried and it works wonder. Definitely a must buy for young people who want to be smart in their day to day activities.Very nice product, this was my first experience with alexa, overall recognisation and sound quality is good , but it is not pairing with my  VU smart TV.Pros:Sound quality was too goodNo lag or delay in responseCons:-Should work with DC power also with battery backup, always we have to connect with AC power.-Without current you can\\'t use this echo dot- listed very few Android TVs (example VU smart tv is not in the list)-Should enhance on \\'Schedule to play any song by scheduled timeClear case of breach of contract.I have purchased a an echo dot on prime day sale for 3250 post discount, but they have marked my order as delivered without actually delivering it.I have raised an issue going through ordeal of multiple calls mails and messages over 8days. Finally what I was given is 1600 rupees refund with a sorry message. Ihave lost 1800rupees straight away without even seeing the product.Howmuch every I try to escalate the issue the response will be the same, \"we can\\'t do anything for you and you have to accept whatever happens\"Now I\\'m understanding how corporate bullying works.Please be careful.1. Bina wifi k nhi chalega only speaker bajao Or wo bhi plug 🔌 k sath laga kar2. Bhut sare information jo Alexa ko pata he nhi hai3.ek baar off hone par dubara connect karne k liye sara wifi Bluetooth connect karna padta hai4.only ye apke waaj nhi parchanta5.har ek dialogue k baad ye chup ho jata haiKul mila jula kar ye Alexa bekar hai isse sakta or acha google home mini mai 1.5 year use kar raha huThe size to sound ratio is just excellent, the emphasis seems to be on voice but the base is absent so this is not for the base head.This is the most responsive voice integration that I have seen, as you say, Alexa, it starts listing. There are a lot of things that you can ask Alexa like adding a product in your Amazon cart, open rain sound, play music, set alarm, etc.The interesting thing is that Alexa also listing commands in Hindi as well. This is only a part of the home automation system. All the smart equipment/products you purchase can be connected with Alexa like a light bulb to control it with voice etc. but for that, you need a router in your home.ConclusionThe speaker does not have a battery but he can be connected via Bluetooth from your phone and PC. Which is a good thing but all of a sudden it stops playing for no reason which is very annoying?I got it in INR 2500, at this price you must buy it, just to experience a smart speaker but in INR 3500 it looks a bit expansive. If you decide to buy this then this going to be the first step to transform your home into a smart home.Feeling pitty on amazon. I have ordered for three product on prime day. But I didn\\'t recieved the product. On the next day itself it says (return recieved) and it was the mistake of courier service and amazon. But when I called the customer service, they ensured me that the placed it again with the same price. But still the status on my dashboard wasn\\'t updated. So I called to customer service again, and he too said same. After 4-5 days I called again, and now they are saying that nothing is updated and I have to place the order again(with today\\'s price). Then what\\'s amazon prime for?! If they can\\'t sell their own product in a wise way.. So disappointing.it was a gift for my brother. And it delayed again. I need a clear action from Amazon service with this matter.Hi I am using this from the beginning and I have echo 3rd gen ordered from Amazon but nowadays when I uses it, it suddenly gets stop and nothing happens  I have to manually swith off and switch on to resolve the issue, and again it happens please do the needful to help me..It is useless device and waste of money it only work with registered WiFi with amazon not with in coming signal of the Alexa app computer or mobile , no one else in the house can use it if registered WiFi is not available and at the same time we can not register two ,three signals . Alexa becomes use less when there is no internet , and there are lot of restrictions like hand free not available when in battery saver mode etc etc . at many a times it can not understand your voice and there are many app\\'s missing in window computer .if i instruct it to teach Gramer to children it can not do . what a useless device it is , i even wanted to buy Fire TV stick but lots of them in used market ,hence i thought there must be some problem like this in that also hence stopped its purchase .My advice to Amazon is make it user friendly . do not restrict to one WiFi signal ,Take the in coming signal or allow us to register two ,three signal there should not restrict Hand free etc .With RegardsRavishankarExcellent service provided by the device.. Only problem is with Eco dot 3rd generation device that it’s only launch an app but never plays a video, especially YouTube.. This feature is a very basic one and should be added with this device which will enhance the product services overall.. Please take it as a consideration. Also it should be connected to atleast 2 Firesticks or 2 TV’s in a single home.. This should be the minimum. I am very much sure, if these two features could be added with this device, it will enhance the overall service of the product and will reach to many other people in India and thus increase the sale of the product..Expensive, Smart speaker works only when plugged in. Bluetooth V2.0 is very old dur to this audio is very poor, sound becomes very low. No battery to support the speaker so if no power you cannot use the device. Sometimes while song change you hear a distorted sound. Not worth the purchase as Bluetooth quality in the speaker is bad. You need to shout then only Alexa can hear you - voice sensor is poor. On full volume Alexa will not recognise your command.My only disappointment is that it does not have battery and when power goes off it dies.Sound quality is very good, good bass but not like woofer.It can be used as Bluetooth speaker. But not sure if Bluetooth earphones works with it. Will update about it later.This review is especially for those sitting on the fence .I’ve been using Google Nest and minis and wanted to shift to Echo for its Drop in feature basically .(the full intercom) . It worked fine. But overall Alexa was disappointing. Even after having 4 mics the voice recognition was only a tad better than Google. The sound is natural but artificially natural, a little muffled as well.The app is poor. What takes less than a minute to setup on Google Home it takes over 3-4 minutes on alexa app. I have over 40 smart devices in my home and the time it needed merely setting up those devices was a bummer. Echo or Alexa is is just popular because Amazon sells it while Google devices are not marketed that much.Better go for Google home..- cannnot make/accept phone calls (only Alexa calls)- cannot place orders on prime now- connected to Samsung smart TV via smart things skill and it can only do basic control like on/off,volume control.-technical customer care is not that good for any support issue.Free Wipro smart light isn\\'t really smart..once power resumes after a power cut you need to switch it off again via app/Alexa.Only worthy use of echo is unlimited music from Amazon music.I was very excited about this purchase and very happy that I got delivered one day advanced and I tried setting up Alexa but ended up unsuccessful for almost 6 hours. Then decided to call Customer service I requested for call back on 7.05pm evening and I call from them on 7.06pm which was amazing and prompt service. The Agent whom I spoke to was Mr. Sami, he was so polite, professional and spoke to for 45 minutes and finally came to know by the agent that the product which I got was reported as stolen or missing product, So that is why I couldn\\'t complete the set up process. I was completely surprised & confused that how come a very big firm like Amazon can deliver a stolen product to their customers and the agent managed to replaceml the product and he gave me end to end service. I was happy with customers service not with Amazon serviceAfter 3 months here are the things which I found.Works better if you have connection of minimum 20 mbps.I have started to get few bugs or software issue.Alexa listens sometimes by itself and says, \\'sorry, I don\\'t know that.\\'Sometimes songs stops playing in middle by itself.It doesn\\'t recognise voice even after activating it many times.After command it doesn\\'t follow.Disconnects and reconnects network by itself.The sound has decreased, now at volume level 3 I can\\'t hear music properly after 3 meters range. (Have same background noice of fan/Vehicles)Amazon please send a software update which solves these.Thanks!The Echo Dot 3rd Gen is comparatively good that than it\\'s predecessor. The sound quality is improved, however there are two things that I would like to being to the notice of it\\'s manufacturer or would say the developers rather. The bluetooth connectivity is no good. it\\'s very difficult to connect to any other bluetooth device. Now coming to the main part of the Echo : voice recognition or rather would say it\\'s integration. The Indian voice is a disaster. Half of the time you will have to repeat even for the simpler terms and words. Half disappointed, else it\\'s good.So i know why you guys are here for.Omg why should i buy amazon echo instead of google home??So good for you here\\'s the answer.I\\'ll not tell you about things you know and everyone\\'s talking about like it\\'s mic and speakers are awsome, it\\'s very localised etc.I\\'ll tell you why you need this if you want this for home.1. This has communication features so people having alexa app or echo device and permission can actually call you on your echo dot.2. This has announcement features so if you are late for dinner you can announce that on your echo device from your phone.(Actually i use this feature to play ghost sounds when little kids are in my room😝)3. This has best features for home automations that google home or any other devices don\\'t have.4. This has best features for timer tasks.5. Scheduling is much more advanced in alexa app.6. If you say turn on light in front of your kitchen echo dot it will turn on only kitchen lights. so you don\\'t have to be specific like turn on kitchen lights like google home.(you need multiple echo devices for this as obvious)So forgot about google home and just buy it.This is the first Echo I have owned. So far I am loving everything that it does from to do lists to news updates and linking my calendar to playing music. It is very convenient and hopefully in the future I will buy more products for it to control like my thermostat and lights. That being said I am wondering why in the world, it being an amazon product, does it not control my amazon fire stick! This is so fustraiting and I hope that amazon will come out with an update soon that will allow the echo to have this option! It seems like it can literally control everything except for the fire stick. This is why I gave it a 4 out of 5 stars.Speaker is good for news and music to some extent But it is worst when Alexa speaks. She sounds muffled and its difficult to understand especially when fan or ac is on The Equalizer wud not manage Alexa\\'s speech it\\'s only for news music etc. Very inconvenientI have 3 echo devices and homepod but Alexa is supercool as an assistant. Problem is only with echo dot 3rd gen. You can go for better echo models. I wud recommend to test it out first then make a buying decisionProduct is good but if a perforated box had been given then it would have been good so that we could have ensured that there is no dust entry and when we operate it because of perforations sound should not be a problem and also the box should have a provision to insert the plug.In this way we could have kept in a place where there is no dust entryMay be for futureregardsWorks seamlessly.No issues so far.Never ignored what I said.Controlls AC, Computer Power, Lights, Music, etc. I\\'m so happy that I\\'ve an assistan that doesn\\'t need any salary.The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0i like the product.its sound quality is awesome but can not recognize my voice properly.i have to speak multiple time. if you want a speaker go for it,don\\'t expect anything else.i think it will going to improve in future but for now its only a expensive speaker. ita a made in china product.i returned it to the sellerI brought two speakers on a sale. Waited for a few months to install when we move to our new home. And placed them in a cardboard box which contains a lot of cardboard boxes of electronics. Termites are attracted to the amazon echo boxes and made a mess and ate almost all the three echo dot boxes. And most interestingly the remaining boxes are stood firm. I don\\'t know what to do now. Please help me Amazon.Great service at a great price. Thank you Amazon.The voice recognition is pretty good. But for this price you get a speaker quality which is decent. Not really so great. You can take it around with you wherever you go. We like to keep it in the hall which is large but it works power pretty well and covers the whole hall. The volume is loud enough for a big room for sure.Don\\'t buy this product if you are not a Amazon prime member.This will work only prime members.I was happy to hear the voice of Alexa that\\'s it. After that what ever I command to Alexa only reply is, this is for prime members.Expect whether report this device don\\'t deliver anything.Planning to return it tomorrow.Please don\\'t get into traps like this.Today they are telling to be a prime member tomorrow they may say upgrade it by paying some money.Thanks Amazon for trapping me. But I won\\'t let others to get trap.Skills which I like specifically are:1. PanchTantra: 100s of Indian stories for kids2. Mein Tota hare rang ka - Indian Rhyme3. Haathi Raja Kaha Chale - Indian Rhyme 🐘4. Tamil Kids Story & Songs (Kathai Padalgal) India5. Indian Rhymes for Kids - Bhola Bachpan (300+rhyme)6. Wild Animals (Animal Kingdom) - Indian Version7. Namokar Mantra - Jain Prayer Daily8. Lord Krishna Meditation - 1 hour Indian Flute9. Jungle Book Indian Song and Stories - Unofficial10. Indian Kannada Kids - Prasagalu & Kathegalu11. Indian Marathi Kids: Stories and Rhymes12. 1 Hour Bhaktamar strota - Jain PrayerAlexa is good in understanding the Indian accent and covering Hindi-English language , it does the job of voice assistant in terms of managing devices around... I tried controlling my Denon AVR X2500h with Alexa, it does the basic task of paying song, changing volume, but can\\'t change the music mode etc. Similarly I can control my Airtel Internet TV set top box once set-top box is swith on, it can not swith it on or off.So it gets the work done upto certain extend but not completely.The biggest problem which is see with Echo devices is that it can not get the information from web though it is connected to internet always, for every thing to do it needs skill.Ideally it should go to web to find some basic answers instead of saying \"I don\\'t know\".If anyone wants to use it just for playing music then this is one of the best smart speaker available in market in given price.I was writing this review after three weeks of usage. I like sound quality in this echo device and very portable device.I dislike voice recognition is not good and whenever I turn on this device for first time it\\'s not connecting to internet need to reset or start it again which makes us irritating everytime.Alexa has integrated to more things but some of the integration not working well.My rating for this product will be 2.5/5Dont fall for this. Though it feels good when it plays few songs however in most of the cases it wont recognize your voice. Also, at high volumes, you will keep on shouting Alexa, Alexa and it wont hear you.Just a stupid toy, may be for kidsIts a absolutely cheating for the customer. If we buy any amazon product . Definitely we want to buy amazon prime members also. In this case if any song want to play absolutely need amazon prime membership otherwise we cannot play music through any other app. No Google Apps are not working through amazon alexa. If anybody want to amazon Alexa . Go For GOOGLE HOME. Its have everything. And also free cost for all AppNot happy it\\'s an ok product  as it does not catch things fast, to add on Amazon prime would have worked better if it sinks in with you tube and Google along with added new features ( off old and new).Another annoying thing is it keeps giving the entire description (ex - song or any movie ) which cannot be put off.It\\'s goes not have want I want.It worked good for about a month. But after that it started hanging. Now most of the times it doesn\\'t recognise my words and many times it gets hanged while playing music. Wipro bulb camed with it also has the same situation. I keep its switch on but Alexa says that bulb is offline. Total waste of money.Pros.1. Sound quality considering its compact design2. Compact. Box is also pretty small hence good to carry even when you travel.3. Great features with lot of additional apps or featured addons4. Does pick up most of the commands very easilyCons1. Intial connectivity took lot of trail. Even though the internet is very fast.Tips.Place it on a wooden table for better bass deliveryI did a lot of research and after much deliberation, I finally decided to go with Echo dot Gen 3 over Google Nest. I have to say, I am totally loving this. I have connected it to my Smart TV, Fire TV, Wipro Bulbs, Camera and Smart Sockets. Overall, I am satisfied and the device is working as expected. The only minus point is that the power cable is using old-style pin connector instead of mini USB which is more a universal standard.This is the second time that I have had to purchase this product, my first echo dot device stopped working and since it was not in warranty I was advised by AMAZON to send it to their CTDI team which handles out of warranty devices. My experience with CTDI has been nothing short of a nightmare. The CTDI team is impossible to contact, they do not respond to emails and their phone service does not work. After having my device for nearly 5 months , I was sent a redicolous high estimate for repair which costs as much as a  new device itself. Not only that , the email coatation is for a fire stick when I sent them an echo dot device. Again no clarification received from them till date even though I have sent a second reminder.My reason to go into such details is that one should never waste ones time with CTDI and what is even more shocking is AMAZON\\'S attitude once your device is out of warranty.AMAZON arrogantly washes their hands of you and your problem .My Nephew is in love with it. At first he was surprised how it could answer all his never ending questions. Now he is so attached with it and guess what we are also relieved now, we don\\'t get so bugged by his all sorts of questions now. Some we knew some we had to research. Now he can himself find out his answers and use it as a PDA for himself.Update:I ordered second one for my another nephew\\'s bday. Its great product to introduce technology to the kids.The product is really good and works fine as per the expectation.Though the proble is once it gets hardware proble as in my case due to fluctuation in power, speaker of my device got damaged. Then I had sent it for repair but in india they can\\'t open the device and repair it hece I was offered to buy refurbished decice at 2000 with just 3 months warranty hence it is like almost paying for a new device with just 3 month of warranty rather than 12 months. Again once 3 month is over for the refurbished device you are on your own if device gets any fault. Hence the vecious cycle of buying refurbished item or new device will continue as there is no option to repair in India.  Hence over dependency on this item will invite this unavoidable vecious circle.This is a good device (or should I say a Toy). It works exactly as promised. So, no complaints over there.BUT,This is more like a toy to me. The day when I bought this I was very excited to use it but eventually my interest faded and now it is just lying around the house. I use it some times to listen to music nothing more because kab tak aap use weather ya news puchoge ya bate karoge. I even have a fire TV stick to pair it with and use voice commands but it is not perfect search so I end up using remote. I even have a wipro smart bulb but the story remians the same.YOU WILL EVENTUALLY (1 WEEK IN MY CASE) GET BORED WITH THIS TOY.This is able to recognize Indian accent really well and the drop in function is helpful for calling the device to talk to the person near the device.  The smart plug can be scheduled and works seamlessly. Cons would be the sound is kindLoud but lacks clarity. The mid frequency needs to be tweeked for optimum clarity and rarely the device doesn\\'t respond when we call AlexaI love my echo dot device. There some things, which are really good like whisper command. I am using google mini for last 1 year, it is also really good but some diff are really noteworthy. I am living in hostel so I don’t want to disturb my neighbour student in night when I command my echo ,which is far from my bed to switch off my light. In google I have to shout (not loud but still enough) in echo I can just whisper, and it responds every single time.  The second thing is during switching off or switching on the light ,  google repeat the full name of my light for example it shouts ” switching on Nikhil Syska bulb” during night if you have forgotten to lower the volume suddenly you will call google “ switch of the light “ it will shout back “ switching off Nikhil Syska bulb “ but echo dot just say “ok” which way more convenient.Though when it comes to connecting to laptop automatically the scenario is totally opposite , google connects silently just making a ping sound and echo repeats my lappy name.The other thing is buttons in place of touch . I like buttons in place of touch , which make its tough to pick the google , most of the time either it play/ pause the songs or increase / decrease the volume . If I have voice assistance, why would I need touch 🙄.Alexa integration- because I use amazon shoping and I have kindle , the integration is very much useful for me . My echo reads my book for me . It remind me if my order is coming today.Portability - it’s shape makes it less beautiful but good in portability. It fits in my bag so conveniently  just ignore the dangling cable.I just don\\'t want to integrate it with anything in my house as it doesn\\'t sound clear via built in speaker and 3.5mm output jack, I brought it for listening music, podcast and GK but due to poor audio clarity it is still not in plugged in state in my home, it is just sitting on table without it\\'s adapter plugged in.I ordered this product because it shows in web description as \"Echo Dot (3rd Gen)\".But when I connected to it with my alexa app, it shows Echo Dot \"2nd Gen\" instead of \"3rd Gen\".I am feeling like cheated.Database need to update, sometimes gives wrong answers, sometimes unable to understand the question and start giving different subjects description. I would like to suggest Amazon to update the Database urgently. one more thing the microfone is getting weaker than when i purchased.Wnna buy only smart speaker--googleWnna get an amazon atmosphere(prime,amazon music,fire tv etc,)--alexaFor a smart speaker its not that smart, nothing works without activating a skill and skills set (trust me not that great, sukhaa pada h yaar) if you only want a smart speaker 🔊 and you are heavily invested in amazon prime and fire tv stick like gadgets and you have other smart compatible devices and you need the help of amazon services very often only then go for it. Until used with amazon family its good but, if you want only a smart speaker then go for google home mini nest version you will be very happy. Alexa is just a very weak ai in front of googleMy son has been asking for a long time. However we weren\\'t buying. This time, we decided to buy. It\\'s an awesome product. we are astonished by its voice recognition capabilty. It\\'s picks up right songs with minimal inputs.We have integrated it with fire stick also.No regrets...I recommend a buy ...Happy Alexaing :)I truly don’t see the point behind Alexa or any smart speaker for that matter.I finally bought it coz it was on offer during sale and I just wanted to see what the fuss was about and I was right, there’s nothing great about a smart speaker.There’s nothing much you can do with it and the charm & novelty wears off quite soon. More of a gimmick than an actually useful gadget.Don’t get me wrong, the product is good but I really don’t see its utility. Buy with your own wisdom & utility.Vary good 😃 but volume not loud.Sound quality is very good  but  volume level is not good.The word had to be more.খুব ভালো 😃 কিন্তু ভলিউম জোরে নয়।সাউন্ড কোয়ালিটি খুব ভালো কিন্তু ভলিউম লেভেল ভালো না।শব্দটা বেশি হতেই হতো।भिन्न अच्छा लेकिन आवाज़ ज़ोर से नहीं।साउंड क्वालिटी बहुत अच्छी है लेकिन वॉल्यूम लेवल अच्छा नहीं है।शब्द अधिक होना चाहिए था।Voice is not recognising what ever we say something like play songs from ABC movies or storieseven we restart device multiple times, could you please help on thisVoice is not recognise and Even I changed default music to amazon music app when I ask Alexa play music from amazon music it\\'s not recognizing tried multiple times its not working can help meWorst software desinged sont blame customers just providing like switch off lightsand ola bokking..etc because whatever we spoken alexa is not listen even it contains builtin jio songs. Lets say examples alexa play  palasa 1978 movie telugu songs..but default its going default liat songs are playing from jio saavan insyead of what i given command... And even we created playlist from differeny music apps(jio saavan,spotify) but its not recognizing. with Ads you are providing whoever developed does they using this? They know the faults...rigorously test software...Please improve this more and more featureA great device to have, makes your life easier, combined with other smart devices it makes your home a smart home,Coming to the product,Build quality is very good, looks great, anti slip base keeps it in place, sound is also crisp clear, sufficient base and enough volume,Connectivity is also good,Cons:- needs constant power supply, would have been better if it had battery backupSuggestion to amazon:If it could be used as bluetooth speakerI got the echo dot on offer and excited to use but voice recognition is not working tried to restart and done troubleshooting steps but no use. Placed for replacement lets see what happens.The main feature of the app echo dot is alexa but for me that is not woorking.First thing i am very happy with amazon deliverythe product is at my hand before 24hrs after I ordered even I am not prime member, it was very good and super fast delivery compare than any othersHere my review after using it 1 weekEcho dot (alexa)  the product is in good condition,features are very smart, you can play variety of any music which are in your mind, alexa can tell you whether info, news, reminder, alarm on single statement spoken by you, feel smartness while talking to alexa, My 3 yr son also like it while speaking with Alexa... he ask to play songs which he likes most... overall i am very happy with this productVery useful one, Luckily no Ads disturbs the Stotralu,Mantralu,Songs so can enjoy uninterruptedly. Audio Quality need to Improve, of course, in  Hugh volume it may OK, but we may not enjoy \" the High Volume Fir the sack of quality. More functions surprises us. Thank to the invented team.I m sorry to say that I was disappointed with this product. I know alexa is v popular with ppl who want to listen to songs. I wanted to listen to kirtan only but cudnt listen. It always played something different. Moreover, it was not linked to YouTube. Had no option but to return the same...Common guys you need to fix the amazon music search results, I search for a song and it gives me a different results and I cant find the original song until I specifically mention the singer. Its very annoying when YouTube music works flawless, sadly there is no inter-compatibility with each other.Also why cant I change the voice, it sounds so robotic, make a better alternative, its one thing that\\'s keeping me away from making it my default voice assistant.Everything else is just great. Sound has much more depth. Google home mini is tuned for better vocal response while echo is for musicNot sure if it is my device or a general issue but the speech recognition is not up to the mark. The device doesnt respond to my device\\'s \"Wake up\" text and I need to shout at the top of my voice to make it react. Not cool.I order this product and the seller was Cloutrail, when I opened the sealed box from amazon it was ok, however the echo dot product box was double sealed.1.The actual horizontal seal was opened before and then the seller had sealed it with normal cello-tape as mentioned in the pic above.2.The manuals inside was not place properly inside the box, as I am 100 per sure this has been opened and used by seller.3. The charging cable of the adapter was in tangled state, and the binding rubber of the wire was not even inside the box.3. The plastic seal was not present in the device. (on the top of interface)4. Even while setting up, I had to reset it to complete the installationWhy did you sent a refurbished product when I ordered for a new one??I will make sure Amazon pays for this!!I have never seen such a dumb device in my life. I remember the small piano or such devices our parents used to give us when we were 6 years old. Whatever you ask it has only few stereotype answers. Playing a desired song is the most irritating part. It never knows what you want to play, instead it plays some fixed song list no matter what you asked her play. Also it also doesn\\'t have songs with filters such as genere, mood etc. My opinion ? DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY.. your mobile is far useful to do things you expect Alexa can ...The reason for 3 start review is, it can\\'t answer simple questions that Google can answer. When there\\'s music playing, I need to shout loud to tell it to pause. Sound Quality is decent but the microphone seems bad. Was happy with home automation commands....But felt absolutely disappointed with the answers.Superb purchase made during the Great Indian Festival Sale by Amazon. I feel so good that I made a right decision of buying this wonderful product by Amazon. It\\'s a small speaker but the sound is enough for a medium to large sized room. It connects with my home Wifi seamlessly.This smart speaker supports voice recognition and it can recognise my voice which is truly amazing.Sound quality is very good and it has a nice clear sound which is loud enough.Alexa integration is the main feature of this product, which is why it\\'s a must-buy for every smarthome.The speaker connects to all my smart devices, namely, Amazon Fire Stick, Wipro Smart Bulb, Wipro Smart Batten, and Wipro Smarthome. It makes my life so easy!Alexa has a lot many supported apps and the number is increasing everyday. You get a lot of interesting apps to use with Alexa. For example, you can order Uber cabs, ask time, play a game, listen to music and what not. This speaker truly leverages the power of Amazon Alexa.Recieved the product in less then 24 hours from amazon with price of 2399 rs. I can say that it\\'s better then gen-4. I have setup the device in my hall. And the sound it produces is immersive. Alexa integration is superb as well as voice recognition. Setup process is very simple. I also got amazon power plug and havels wifi bulb. I paired all three device in 2 minutes. And then it is ready to go. I can say that one should give it a try to have the experience of technology. Completely satisfied 🙂Interaction with Alexa quaility is very W roust...Alexa software is very bad..No Use ..compared to Google Voice.Compared to Phone Google Voice is better response and good result.Alexa not matured, No knowledge upgraded compared to google voice.Alexa Device is No Use compared to google voice in Phone.Mico is not good quality.Different answers for simple questions from Alexa.Alexa replay is not good.This device not good for playing for few days.. Fully boring with alexa replay.Waste of Money.We have to wait for New latest generation software for alexa until its waste of product.Pros1. It explains Vocabulary2. for English and Hindi Songs ( that only specific to jio saavan or amazon music ) Cons1. It cannot recognize voice with low volume from a distance more than a 1.5 m2. It cannot Understand and Play many Telugu songs. It only suggests songs which are available on the music app which you have kept default or amazon music.3.Bluetooth connection with the device very difficult to set up if you have not used it for a while4. Changing a Wifi Network takes a lot of time. Every time u need to enter set up mode ( Orange Color light with pressing dot button ). It is better if we can directly change from app.Overall I think this was super value for money. I haven\\'t used any other smart speaker before but I am very happy with my purchase. Below are some observations :1. Initially it feels a bit weird talking to a speaker but you get used to it in no time.2. The sound quality is pretty good. You get good depth of sound with decent bass.3. Several skills available and you will definitely find some very useful. For example adding stuff to shopping list or setting up a reminder.4. Understands the Indian accent very well. Sometimes I am amazed by how well it picks up stuff.6. Kids love it. An added advantage is that they can take help for homework and talking to alexa also motivates them to talk in English.7. Now Amit ji voice on alexa but Alexa sweet enough to entertain you.Best home usable device for entertainment.. If you are thinking to buy it or not, then I\\'m sure that you will get thrill and enjoy after buying it. I was also thinking same but then I bought it for Rs.3000 during discount period. So, wait and buy it when it goes to price of Rs.3000 or below.Currently, it is Rs. 3500 but wait and I\"\\'m sure that it will go down to Rs.3000 within a 1 or 1.5 month. Just wait and check regularly the price of this product (check daily atleast once).If you thinking to buy google home mini, then don\\'t buy at all, I\\'ve experienced both. Echo dot is thousand times better that it. Google home mini don\\'t recogine your voice well and can\\'t perform e-commercial and play games activities.I was thinking of buying this echo dot for a very long tym! & one day i got a 1000 rs cashback in my amazon pay balance (reason is still i dont know)😹So i brought this echo dot for a net amt of 1499/- & it was a super cool offerConnectivity was suprr quick & i connected all my bedroom appliances with alexaRoutines setup was super fun ⚡️⚡️she plays my fav soundtracks , she sings for me , say hi to my friends , sets alarm for me , and there is a lot lot things that she doesPacking was super  & delvry boy was very coolI am enjoying alexa\\'s company very well & thankyou amazon for d productEverything looks good.sound quality and responsiveness to commands are perfect.Only negative is its a plug n play device ,in that price they should have provided battery in it and then we can carry everywhere we want with us and use it as a absolute bluetooth smart device.thats why im giving 4 star rating.whenver power is off or the supply stopped by turning the switch off by someone, u need to setup again for alexa dot to work, its such a hectic and irritating process and once it setup you cant move this device to someother place without turning the power supply off and need to reconnect the device.I had Google donut but it failed miserably, Echo dot is much better ...however it doesnt recognize some questions. But nevertheless good device. But the smart bulb I got with it is very very tough to adjust with it through app, still havent been able to do it as the bulb instructions arent veryclearI am not criticizing this product but I hope it helps to improve the quality in future.The speaker quality is very good I will give 6 star out of 5 stars..but the question understanding ability is very very very worst.. if any question asked it gives irrelevant answers..It answers only for simple qustions like what\\'s time, what\\'s my name like that 🤦If I want to play desired songs in local language I has to tell alexa for atleast 5 to 10 times to understand to get exact song 🤦🤦But I am not returning this product back because I like the audio output sound very much.I have both Google Home and Alexa.Alexa works better with smart devices. It responds much quicker to requests on turning light on/off compared to GHome, which clearly lags.However, Alexa lags GHome on answering questions and playing music. When asked to play music, it frequently responds with \"Saavn is not available in your region\" while playing Saavn other times. Also it\\'s response to natural language questions is behind GHome.Speaker quality great. Speaker sensitivity excellent-it catches the wake word even when spoken from a distance. GHome lags here.Like.Product is good. Integration with Amazon music is good.DislikeNo battery back up. So it occupies the power point. Not portable as well. Major disadvantage for the price paid. The same size of branded wireless speakers are far cheaper.A must have product in your room. It does understand English and Hindi questions and queries better than \\'Google Home\\' and also the sound quality is excellent when compared. Bluetooth feature comes very handy and notification light-blinking is also a great way. Better build quality than the previous generations. Featured skills are also available on the Alexa app including the Alexa-calling and broadcasting features. Mic is also very responsive too. Bass of the speaker is sufficient for a medium-sized room. Only issue is that with the manual buttons on the top which \"for my taste\" looks very ugly. Although if looks are not the priority then it is THE BEST buy in the smart-speaker segment today.Alexa doesn\\'t understand the commands properly.I ask to Play Sainyoo Nee it Plays Sainya Ve.I ask to Play. It plays some other languages radio station which we don\\'t understand.It is not able to recognise the Wipro Bulb.I am fed up with Alexa. I want to return it back. If Possible.Product is good, after using for a month, felt bad, I should have gone to 4th generation, few features are missing in it, just a suggestion should have added micro sd features too, to listen for some downloaded songs also. All features are good and working well, HAPPY WITH THE PRODUCT.I didn\\'t like the sound signature, I had to reduce the Bass to 0 and mid and treble to 10 to make it suit my ears. The Alexa app is very sluggish. It\\'s very well built, can recognise voice from distance, options are less as compared to google assistant.Best Smart Speaker I have bought , Got it a very good price during Amazon Great Indian Festival, got it for around Rs 2200 along with Smart Led Buld.Pros :1. Very Good build quality.2. Superb Design3. Amazing Audio Quality4. Very good audio songs collection.5. Helps is various smart task like controlling smart lights at home.Cons :1. Not portable like a Bluetooth speaker as it requires power and internet.Overall I am very satisfied with this product. I can recommend this if you are someone looking for a smart speaker with good sound quality.Please note you will enjoy this device only when you will be prime member of Amazon (1000 k/year).Otherwise it\\'s very bad after few days. Initially you will enjoy voice command, but it\\'s not accurate and limited. So you will want to control it from mobile. But it\\'s only possible to prime members.Worst ever delivery experiance from amazon..your otp based delivery is the worst thing. Getting frustrated by waiting for otp after delivery...especially at times of mobile network failures...no msg came for otp.... no option to re send the otp.. no instant customer care number to contact... user enemy application... if your algorithm fails to satisfy our customer needs give us an alternate to reach your customer care....  here after i wont use amazon for purchasing any thing..... give us alernative if your algorithm fails...  dont make us fools  by your algorithm  rules... one star for makes us frustrated by your delivery rules..It\\'s quite a simple, yet powerful device. While the voice recognition system still needs to improve. The range of microphones is wide and it wakes up on calling, instantly, most of the time. The speaker quality is good and pairing two of the for a stereo configuration will make it much better. Alexa works well as advertised and with additional skills, it can become better. Would love to see more regional language officially supported as it\\'s right now restricted to Hindi only.Its not good as i thought about it.Even its not working according to my expectations.Whenever i ask or ordered somethingAlexa didn\\'t perform its 100% even its doesn\\'t know some common locations or alexa doesn\\'t know about very common songs singer n album\\'s its totally worthless in this task nd this is the biggest issues i faced with alexa and the last thing is alexa doesn\\'t satisfied my expectations 😑😐So its totally up to you guys either you improved its skills or take my suggestion,queries nd issues lightlyIt depends on you guys,you take this note as my humble request or a joke but seriously its not a joke 😇😇I am Your one of the well wisher not a judge 😊Pros1. Sound Quality Superb,2. device looks great stylish.3. Alexa is too good only in those things which are shown in TV ad. Dim the light, play animal sound, so on. But world does not end here.Cons1. Integration with other device poor and take lot of time. Software and app working is poor.2. Voice recognition - Extremely poor especially when volume is above 5. Sometime I have scream, You feel like better Google kar leta kaha Alexa ko bola diya. 😀3. Music - When you say play 90s songs, it starts with same set and sequence of songs. Boring.4. Every time we have keep for charging.5. After Wipro smart bulb price deduction, effectively Alexa cost me 1700/-, but won\\'t feel worth. As a speaker only yes it is.At last Good affords by Amazon but long way to go.I purchased Amazon Alexa 3rd Generation in November 2020. Since, April 2021 whenever I connect my phone through Bluetooth and play something on it through my phone, the sound that comes from it is distorted.And then I asked for help from amazon. They told me to purchase the same new device since it\\'s a COVID pandemic, so I agreed and bought a new device, and when the device delivered to me after 4 days it was also having the same issue as the previous one, so I called in Amazon help services and registered a complaint, they told me to pair another mobile through Bluetooth so I paired during the phone call to Amazon helpline and played something on it, then it was working perfectly alright, but when I played through the new paired mobile on next day the sound was distorted.I recommend not to buy this device.Excellent device! After Fire TV Stick this is my 2nd Amazon made smart device & it once again surprises me. Sound quality is good enough. Voice recognition also works great. Only drawback is there is no Spotify integration, So I have to depend on Amazon Music/Jiosaavan which are both crap. Except that it\\'s a great smart little device through which you can elaborate your smart life quite amazingly.Superb product. Easy to setup and so convenient to use. I\\'ve set it up to link to my Spotify account so you get even a larger database if music with Prime music and Spotify combined.The sound quality surprised me. I have many other portable speakers but this one is one of the better ones.GO FOR IT.I bought this in offer in 2290. I liked the product as the speaker quality is good for a bedroom size. The voice recognition is good. Overall the Alexa works fine but of course there are flaws in understanding of instructions by Alexa because artificial intelligence is still just the tip of the iceberg. I don\\'t think it would have been a good buy if bought above this price.We have been using Echo dot for playing Music with Kids around. It becomes easier to play songs without have to look out for the Phone. So less screen time in front of Kids and more family time.Speaker volume is good for hall. Good for in-house get-together.I have been using it for almost 5 months and till now I don\\'t have any problem with it.It recognises most of the commands give to it. It surfs information from Google to give accurate answers.I liked that it\\'s speakers are very loud and clear sound quality.Works excellent for both Hindi and English commands.Not much difference between echo dot 3rd generation and 4th generation.Alexa needs some real upgrade in general. As for the Echo Dot 3rd Gen, VERY POOR Voice Recognition. I literally have to yell for Alexa to listen. Be it cranking the volume, changing tracks, or anything whatsoever. Had quite some expectations since I proudly own a fire stick. Even after buying the speaker (which I bought mainly for the purpose so that all my favorite music could come in handy), I still prefer to play music on my TV than on my speaker. I mean why buy a speaker if you can\\'t even play music on it without a fuss. Overall, it\\'s a big NO. HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED.I bought echo dot 3rd gen and was so happy with it that I bought echo input s week after. The ease of using without the phone or laptop is great. The sound is good enough. Obviously it cannot compare with big standalone speaker. I have connected the dot to my big speakers and using input in any room I want because it is portableWhen we cast amazon music with exhi it recognises only straight forward songs. No podcast or stations are played in echo. And it even does not recognise podcast through voice. The alexa app is also too slow  Better to go for googleHi guys if u have Wi-Fi in your house only than... Buy it or else.... U need to use your phones hotspot and connect .... And one.... More thing is u need to plug it everytime u can\\'t take it and roam lik other Bluetooth... Speaker\\'s..... These are cons of this, I hope Amazon bring solution for.... This.. ,,, rest everything is fine...Have issues of unresponsive behaviour rarely  and needs a restart for immediate use or had to wait few minutes, mine works 24*7 so may be that\\'s an issue? This is my second Echo and it\\'s worth using at home if you have smart switches installed.I was using google all along. Bought alexa for a variant. 3rd gen is good. Bass and treble are very nice in that product range. Overall loved the product. Got the product after one week of struggle and follow up with amazon. A very bitter experience in the last 8 years of mydealing with Amazon.Echo dot  this is awesome. Very happy 😊1. Its speaking2. It\\'s very kind3. Telling information and what\\'s today weatherAlso my daughter love alexa because it speaks 👌And it plays music and indian songs 😊We are very glad that it speaks and moreThanks to amazon 👌Alexa is great. For a bedroom or a living room, Alexa works like magic. I also got a light (Wifi enabled) from wipro along with Alexa as a package and it had works wonder for us.It understands Hindi, English and also talks with us when we are alone or lonely.You can also connect Alexa with your mobile using it as a Bluetooth speaker. It\\'s a true fact that this version has to be plugged in all the time- but apart from this- its just GREAT! I loved it and a true fan of ALEXA!U can better buy some 500+ speaker. Bcuz I\\'m using kdm speaker. Its wireless, bluetooth speaker, pendrive & memory card can b used. If we put charge for 6-8hrs fully, thru our mobile bluetooth we can check charge percentage & it can b play for 3hrs more. For setting alarm r schedule program, songs etc Alexa not required. Alexa is totally waste, can\\'t use without power, sngs restricted only with prime n few,Works great! Though it doesn\\'t make anything significantly easier, it\\'s a nice addition to ones room and also a good starting point to experience the future.Audible Suno is a superb bonus to this product. And also most used music services like gaana and jio saavn are free to use, which makes this very useful. Last bust not the least, it can easily revive the dying interest in you about the radio channels.But also be aware that you are signing up for some sort of compromise in your data privacy!Alexa is ok nice speaker n mic . But not recommending for it.Amazon executive contacted me and helped with steps of connecting wipro garnet.. Appreciated for taking concern of customer and about how to use Alexa.. Thank you Amazon.I bought first Alexa 3500 work preety well but after few days I saw same item in amazon from same seller cloud tail in 2399 why there is big price difference. That mean this product doesn\\'t value 3500So stop fooling customer.The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0Thanks to Amazon for this amazing product at an amazing Price in this Great Indian Festival: I was lucky to get this Echo Dot bundled with Wipro smart bulb @1999 !Now the important thing : How to be able to use it in Hindi . First go and check the software version of ur echo dot from ur Alexa App in the smartphone ( go to the \\'Device\\' menu at the down right corner in the app).  I have uploaded the pic of the updated software version till today 07.10.2019. Just command echo dot \" check for software updates\" . Echo dot will start updating ur software for a little time.Wait until a blue ring appears in ur echo dot. Don\\'t prompt anything to the echo device during the update.After the update u can set the device language to Hindi (India) in ur device settings.I have uploaded a small video to show that it is really working smoothly.Hope this review will be helpful to people who wants to use it in Hindi like me.She\\'s family member now. Great way to keep kids talking to her and yet away from sceen. being working parents we don\\'t get much time to keep talking to kids, but now they have someone to answer all the time. I now  never forget taking calcium after setting reminder. Worth buyingHiI don\\'t know where to start. Since day 1 there is issue in configuring wifi. The steps not helping. Alexa support is horrible. Seems they don\\'t care. I don\\'t know what to do with this alexa. Use as a 2300 INR speaker ?Song selection can be based on language and application preferred. When say intend to hear a Tamil song like \\'Play Muthu movie songs\\' it plays muthu Telugu songs. Mostly not play from Amazon music.so it is difficult to play our selection.when I say retro from 80s Tamil songs, it plays very old songs from 60s as alternatively.I bought the black one.the speaker outer looks dusty not as fresh peace.Just love it .. awesom product, awesom integration with all products, must buy if you love automation, using since last 1 week and I would say may b i should buy it long back...makes life so easy. I am amazed with Alexa...she can do anything and everything as per instruction..more important she is listneing and follow your order perfectly .. Alexa is the only one who is listening me and do what I want , better than my wife ;)Bought it during Diwali Sale for Rs. 2449/- and Wipro Smart Bulb for Rs. 99/-... And to be honest, it is an amazing device which makes ur life easy!!!Though \"Google Home\" gives satisfactory answers than \"Echo Dot\" for the questions  which are asked, but the Sound Quality that \"Echo Dot\" offers is just AMAZING...If u are confused about which one to buy, i.e, \"Google Home Mini\" or \"Echo Dot\", then I would suggest for Echo dot because of its overall performance...And coming to the Smart Bulb, I would say that, it is kinda a good product which u can get at a low price...Are you a lonely person? Do you need someone to talk to? If yes go for it. If not DON\\'T BUY IT. Unless you want to be like Alexa Play this song and want to hear Sorry infinite number of times.. Please buy any other cheap bluetooth speaker because she won\\'t get connected unless you have a wifi and plus even with wifi she is not worth it.Not at all worthy. Wastage of money. Performance is not good. And Amazon is not cooperating for return. I got the exchange product today but as usual the set up button is so uncomfortable and its painful to press it for a longer time. And the sound quality is so pathetic that music doesn\\'t seems to melodies. It feels like a non branded local speaker. As usual the wrist product from Amazon. Really unexpected from a Amazon. Very disappointing and Amazon team is not even ready to give my money back.Is there a need for a review? Echo Dot is smooth in its functioning, did not have to train our voice etc it did it auto for all in family. Integrating with the smart bulb was so smooth. It is worth the money, especially if you want to enjoy music and connect up smart devices in your home.Amazon Echo Dot (3rd Gen) is the best in terms of hardware. Amazing sound quality with proper balance between base, mids and treble. And yes you can configure too in the Alexa app if you’d like.Next, is the build quality. It is really good and feels firm. Bluetooth and wi-fi connectivity is awesome. Best part is I can connect it to my phone & laptop and use it as an external speaker.The only downside for me is Alexa. She needs a lot of improvement in terms of knowledge. Basic things are carried out pretty well like reminders, alarms, music, etc. however, when it comes to answering questions she fails most of the time.Tip: Keep adding skills in the Alexa app for improvement.Waste product as it doesn\\'t come with a baterry so it needs always a plug point to be connected. Basically it can be used only in home and not outdoor. In today\\'s portable live this is a waste of purchase and doesn\\'t solve any purpose without portabilityIt\\'s amazing product my daughter  want alexa and now she is very happy I m rating used after 2 months fabulous  product  i m speechless  must by guys its very helpful and it\\'s very funny entertaining  and math solver with funny games And jokes and horror stories + normal stories easy to setup  with different languages And volume is very good low - high and etc must buy and thnx amazon  for this geourgeous  productDevice is very good. Sometime they confuse about the similar word like if I ask one song and if that song has same words of some other song then Alexa will play any song. Other issue I found that Ji Saavn songs not played on Alexa. I don\\'t know the reason. In case if we ask to tell story then Alexa says you have nothing in Kindle app. Or sometimes ask many things need to be purchased. Anyone has faced issues can you tell me solution. Atleast i want know how to connect jio saavn songs to AlexaExpected more from this product like we can use at any place if we have internet but it won\\'t work in that way because it doesn\\'t have battery we should plug all the time to socket and also it don\\'t have option to connect different internet connections automatically.I understood that it will useful for listening music and to ask regular queries.Music also it will play all the time from our playlist.Especially we have to use this product only at homeSetting up the device is real pain. And making any changes to the existing set up is more painful. Speaker quality is good. Voice assistance works good for music playing but not for any other stuff. Google assistance can be better.This might be helpful for you all. So my request is for technical team about this product please do not delete my review.It has got really bad software. Most of the answers of this alexa would be \"sorry i don\\'t know that one\" , \"i am not sure\" which is very annoying & you will get to know this by the time.. google is much much better than alexa. Google is google knows every answers of your question. Alexa is not that good its good for like tuning light on or off, other than that you\\'r taking it for knowlegde purpose  its not good. Even alexa dont know many of the hit bolleywood song if command it by saying name of the song or artist. I think google is doing better job than alexa. It has really bad software trust me.Excellent product from Amazon. Worth money. Suitable for those who want to make a smart home of their dream. Wake word \"Alexa\" is more heard than \"echo\" in echo dot. So i prefer \"alexa\". 3rd gen is far good than the previous gen.  Wanna try echo input and echo show also in future. All the best for the team behind AI and Smart tech.Item is good....but sometimes if the TV is running and there is a disturbance then it will not pick up your voice....Also the another issue that I found was I am unable to configure it to my Samsung smart TV...which is one of the major drawback....else 5 star ratings for rest of the featuresI bought this speaker just to automate a few tasks ended up loving the speaker and alexa so much that im buying another speaker for the other room aswell the footprint of this speaker is small but it has a way stronger speaker with good base for its size i was planning connecting it to a bigger speaker but i ended up not doing that because it really packs a punch in audioThe media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0The echo dot is an incredibly awesome amazon product.Talking about the sound quality, the sound quality is beyond expectation for me, its crystal clear and quite loud as compared to its size. Alexa integration is great, it can do things like movie tickets booking, can book a cab, it can easily be linked to apple music or other streaming services, can read news and specially it can understand hindi which is awesome. Talking about the 4 mics integrated in the device. These mics works just awesome, it does not matter how loud the music is or how far you are from alexa in a room, all you have to do is say “Alexa” and she activates. The best part is it does not matter how much noise in the environment, she can hear you. Echo dot can be easily linked to other devices.It also works with almost all the smart home devices.( smart bulbs, hubs, microwave, etc)*Note: Echo dot requires a high-speed wifi connection (more than 20Mbps) for better experience. It also requires permanent power supply. If you need a portable echo dot you can go for the portable one which was launched in December 2019.Really love dis product..... didnt expect this product to be too gud ...Best thing is the way it communicate in eng and in hindiDe only drwaback i see is not inclusion of spotify in it.De product is really gud go for small speaker as it can easily connect with ur home theatre and gives u de better experience and u can save some bucks 😅Everything is good but sometimes voice recognition doesn’t work, while playing it stops in between for no reason and also you cannot link youtube with Alexa which is kind of sad but its ok. Overall its a good buy. Few flaws here and there but works fine.Good one, getting more intelligent with every update. Can be used as auxiliary speaker.Good quality speaker. However, you have to install the various skills to unlock it\\'s true potential (skills are free to install). I have installed akinator ( Alexa guess the person you think) and it is a nice time pass. Good voice recognition.The product is great for the price. I bought it for 2799 and it works well. Sound defection and quality is good too. Just the only issue is that sometimes it won’t recognize the commands and it doesn’t have good bass as compared to google home mini. But at this price range, it is a go go.It\\'s a waste guys.Settings are very complex.Cannot able to connect as a Bluetooth speaker to my mobile.If I say Alexa play tollywood songs it plays Bollywood songsNo matter what it won\\'t able to understand your commands in indian accemts.Sound quality is very good and 4 inbuilt far field mic s are useless because I will not catch your voice from 2 metre distance also.have to shout loud.Either it understands Hindi or English bases upon settings, not bilingual.Anyhow I got it for 1657 approx.Would prefer Google assistantI have got it replaced but it\\'s again not working and now fed up  with it\\'s performance. I asked amazon to replace it with Eco Dot 4th generation and willing to pay difference but they do not agree and willing to pay difference amount which will occur to get new 3rd generation eco dot.All good experience but the application is confusing and no digital wellbeing or parental control like Google and the voice is not much clearer but bass is very impressiveSome improvements is required that all Good.Most of the times response is \"Sorry i don\\'t know\". To play video you need to add akill, to play audio you need to add skillto play movies you need to add skill. I mean seriously? Is Amazon so dumb that they want user to add all those skills manually instead of adding them by default?It cannot connect to smart tv, poor voice recognition, you literally have to shout so that she can here it. If you say \"Alexa play nursery rhymes on Youtube on fire tv\" it will say I don\\'t know what is YouTube. WTH Man!The audio quality is really nice as compared to the size of the speaker, mostly used to listen to classic songsSongs are played incorrectly most of the time unless the Alexa is not given specific keywords of the song by checking on \\'Google\\'Connecting home devices like lights & TV is only to switch on or off so doesn\\'t make sense to pairAll and all the speaker is not upto the my expectations and Google is way way betterHappy customer. Sound quality and voice command is amazingly good. But one thing you must ensure that if you need best experience, better opt for Amazon Prime subscription first. Coz it will sure work with other music apps, but you will not get the great collection of Amazon Music.What I hate is it skips songs from a playlist.I have saved  Sundarkand which has 4 parts in Amazon music.Alexa skips part  2 or 3 and plays the next one.This has happened 4-5 times.I have written to alexa help center but no response on this.I have gone back to mobile app .Extremely awesome and well integrated device. I watched a lot of videos claiming that google home is much better in software and search related tasks. But seriously saying you can go for it without a second thought. I didn\\'t found any trouble with search related tasks however continued conversation is a bit limited but rest everything is just awesome. And a HIGHLIGHTED POINT \"GOOGLE CAN\\'T BEAT THE SKILLS AND EASY OF USE OF ALEXA\". Alexa comes with thousands of skills and fun games and much more.....Playing music, knowing about weather or latest news, setting reminders etc have never been easier. My kid is a big Alexa fan and keeps interacting with the echo dot. Clearly it\\'s very easy to use. Though, it was a bit difficult to connect with the OnePlus TV. Some basic TV functions can be performed but there is lot more required. The next generation devices will probably have more advance features.Echo was good with superb sound bought along with wipro smart bulb... both are working as I expect... but echo has to improve skills rather than entertainment....most of the time i ended with not getting as I want.... mainly after query echo has to repeat the query and then it follows... but no need to repeat the query...... makes user more comfortableProduct is good.Sound quality is soft. I bought two and plays it in synchronised. That is amazing it feels like just one is played at two different angle.Alexa assistance is too good. You can read books from kindle. You can play books from audible aur suno audible just by audio command. Worthy of price but I sti6 suggest to buy in sell you will get good discount.It can control my smart light. Read podcasts and play music and generally answers questions. Big drawback is, it can\\'t control my Mi TV. So go for it only if you want to as there is not much practical need for itSimply the worseee device when it comes to connecting to internet....in the world where every things seems to pull off  easily with the help of internet ..trust me instead of making things easier for you alexa devices especially amazon echo dot makes things ostentatiously difficult for you ....a sheer wastage of time.... stay away from itIt is very Portable Device we can\\'t take it anywhere with us but the place where we keep, it take less space. Voice recognition is Better will play a song it recognition the Voice proper. Now coming to the Integration or its intelligences or AI it is Good, Skills are good, there can be More Skill which can make it best like play Music from YouTube this skill must be there. Over all my experience is good with Alexa.BY THE WAY AMAZON ECHO DOT IS VERY COOL DEVICE I FOUND EVER I LIKED I GOT THIS PRODUCT 3 DAYS BEFORE I ORDERED AT 5 NOVEMBER AND GOT MY PARCEL 8 NOVEMBER I APRICIATE FOR THAT ITS LOOK VERY FUTURISTIC I LIKED THE RING LIGHT ON TOP BOTTOM ITS SPEAKER ARE VERY LOUD MY PARRENTS WERE DENYING TO BUY THIS DEVICE BUT LITTERALLY MY PARRENTS USE THI SDEVICE MOST OF THE TIME BTW THANKS AMAZON ECHO DOT FOR BECOMING AN MEMEBER OF MY HOUSE THE VOICE RECOGNIGION IS PRETTY GOOD AND SHE REPLIES VERY FADT AND WELL I THINK WHOSE HO ARE THINKING TO BUY A SMART SPEAKER U SHOULD GO THROUGH WITH THIS DEVICETHANKREGARD SDEEP SINGHASound Quality of the echo dot 3 is just exceptionally good seeing the size and its form factor.The setup is a really easy process and in no time you are ready to use this amazing Device. Build Quality is also very nice , the device feels solid and the plastic does not feel cheap.A definite buy for those looking for a alexa enabled / Smart Speaker.Amazing product just go for it. But there is one con if you are buying this for playing songs plzz don\\'t because sound quality is not that great but it is good, but don\\'t worry you can connect your speakers and sub woofer to alexa via aux or Bluetooth. The last thing I wanna say it\\'s amazing, you even can play games with alexa like kbc, wheel of fun and many more.

My options was a Sony speaker with cost nearly 3500 and Echo.As I was a prime member at great India festival the Echo came for 2000, and u decided to buy it. The speaker arrived.On my opinion1. Sound quality is really mind blowing, I was amazed by see the sound quality for this small speaker. Really impressive !!!2. Voice recognition is super due to its 4 microphone.3. Allen’s is really friendly and easy to useTo see a detailed review you can check my YouTube channel-“ 3 MAC “.This product is small cute and beautiful.The LED light very helpful in many way. Eg to see the voice level.Its a very nice addition to your house. a perfect asst. The price that it comes at, its totally value for money. Works perfectly well, syncs with the light apps and is a perfect companion. Plays music, operates lights, reminds you of your tasks, games, jokes... the list is extensive. sound quality is also very good compared to the size. over all - a good buy. Perfect for gifting as well.it can be used in car; need to buy one 12v adapterSparkel 12V Car Cigarette Lighter Power Connection Cigaret Socket Male Adapterthen fix one DC Plug pin 4.0 x 1.7 mm to this (usual size DC pin size is 5.5 x 2.1 mm)Amazon Echo 3rd Gen is really a good personal assistant and it\\'s price worth.It\\'s features1. Easy to connect from your android phone.2. Easy to play songs, listen news, Headlines, weekly news, sports news and many more.3. Able to answer basics questions easily but sometimes it\\'s not able to search on Google and it will then reply by saying \" o don\\'t know that.4. Good sound quality ( really good Bass )5. At the price of 2000 INR.  It\\'s a good speaker as comparison to others. So don\\'t wait more thinking to buy or not. Just order it and enjoy the Amazon Alexa.6. One thing should be needed is that it\\'s connectivity from Google or any other sear h engine. So that it can search over that and can find easly the answer of any question ask by the user.7. And also need to improve some security features over securing users data and some sound detection mechanism.8. Overall it\\'s a good speaker along with a good personal assistant.Maybe I was unlucky as Alexa at times didn’t respond to voice commands. We have jiofiber at home with speeds upto 150 mbps, given the internet speeds Alexa should not have problems with responding to voice commands. Returned the product and was disappointed, could be one of defective product.The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0Most of the time dont understand what song you are requesting...most popular songs cant be played...which is very annoying. But good for alexa devicesI like the sound clarity with Alexa interaction but Alexa most of the things and questions didn\\'t identify and she is not known about the questions. That is the minus point here. I saw Google Assistant is better than the Alexa because Google can make the call to your contacts but Alexa is only for those people who installed the Alexa Application on their phone.It doesn\\'t recognize your voice from a distance, when it\\'s already playing a song. U need to go near always. At times we need to keep repeating our commands again and again. Else all good.The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0The seller has sent a used product deliberately. The seal was tempered.The product has dust flakes on the body.Gets disconnected every time I lift it, must be Some problem with the power socket.It in an amazing deviceThe user interface is so extraordinaryAlthough it takes time to understand and respond and only has data according to amazon however it ia fun and interactive even kids love it and it does make works easy if you have alexa enabled device at your place.A must have gadget for your home or workplace!!!!Amazing! This product is just amazing. You just have to say Alexa no matters how much loud background is it picks up your voice. And sound quality of Alexa is the best. Even hindi can be used very well. It is just like a physically person talking to you.I know people make a really productive of use of alexa but it really isnt useful if youre just wanting to get it for entertainment purposes as the speaker quality isnt that great if youre planning to listen to music and it overalls gets booring after a while and would lie unplugged in a corner of a room.My expectations was very high when I bought Alexa Eco dot speaker.When I Say play song “gulabi ankhe ho teri Dekhi” it doesn’t understand and plays different song.Sometimes I have to shout on Alexa while giving the command to Alexa for playing song,bcz of software issue it does not listen in a one time.I am really fed up with Alexa speaker and I do not use it.Amazon I did not expect from you😡Product is good but the pricing is quite tricky. i purchased @ 3500 for fathers day special offer and the next day you put it up for 2799.So fathers day special price was higher than normal.Very easy to connect with the phone. Easy to use.you can even make calls to connected devices and make announcements which is so cool. The plug can be connected to fairy light.UPDATE- GOT MY ALEXA REPLACED BY AMAZON.(Mic works fine now)THE NRW ONE WORKS FINE. BUT THE SOUND QUALITY LEAVES ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT. Mic isn\\'t proper. Please return this product.It feels like there is a problem with my device only.It cannot her me at 1st or 2nd time. after I speak the wake work multiple times then it hears.The sound quality is good at low volume but when you increase the volume it get distorted sound gets really hursh. Low end gets compressed. They need to improve the sound dude surely not for audio enthusiasm but for daily tasks. Got it at just 2k including smart LED I think it gets its value. Bluetooth connection is poor. I don\\'t if i like it or not.Echo dot as a device it\\'s really good.. the sound effect is pretty loud more than expected.. on software side it needs lots of improvement. The microphone won\\'t work for calls or meetings.. so this echo dot device is pretty good for music lovers and smart homes but not for regular use.. we can\\'t use this device like other Bluetooth devices.. n one more main issue u can\\'t carry it bcoz it needs to plugged in to work..i got echo dot for 1137/-  & added smart bulb to cart which costed  586/-Total =1724(1137+586)Sound quality- best in this category(smart speakers)Bluetooth connectivity- pairing with other Bluetooth speaker needs patience. Bcoz most of time it doesn\\'t recognize.Alexa- does 90% of the tasks. Could be better.Its too good to have it at home, kids loving it. We just need to add skills and ask related questions. I ordered a smart bulb also and adding that skill is just taking a minute and after that just ask Alexa to switch on or off, change color..wow..amazing. Overall its a must buy product.Really good product to buy.there are pro & cons for everything,so this also has it as you can\\'t use alexa without adapter, it needs continuous power supply to be active which I feel bit weird else everything is perfect .Amazon is now become synonymous to excellent quality. I bought this during great Indian sale and this echo dot 3rd generation is mind blowing. Super voice recognition and amazing response as usual. Be is product quality or delivery, Amazon is excellent.That should be wireless. So that it can be easy to carry without a switch. Just because of wire it\\'s so annoying.It is useless for without activation you will not to listen the song if you not subscribe after one month. You will never to play songs through mobile Bluetooth. But I bought it for 2000 rupees in the sale.Not one wifi enough for connecting the Alexa but you need connecting mobile through WiFi.I own an Echo Plus, and now I\\'ve added the Echo Dot to my living room. It makes life so much easier, since I live in a Bungalow, with my family on the ground floor and me on the first. Dropping in to say something, or have a distant conversation without yelling becomes so much more easier. It\\'s a blessing.Now having used Amazon\\'s Echo products for over 6 months, I sincerely feel that it\\'s becoming increasingly difficult to survive without it in my day-to-day life. Awesome product by Amazon. Kudos to this phenomenal creation.Sound Quality is best for its price and can be used as only speaker but that\\'s jut 1000Rs. expensive than Mi speakers or even JBL if brand value considered.connectivity and Voice recognition is worst amongst all even including Google speakers and apple one\\'s.e.g. try Ishare tere by Guru Randhawa on this and some similar type of songs it will either play random songs or just english one\\'s.It is a good product at this price but has major limitation of being wired connection. It takes 30-40 secs to start again and anything you want to listen you have to add in ur app which is a time consuming activity.  But overall i took it for my 2 yr kid to distract him from mobile phones and it is helping me in that 😊😊 he enjoys dance well on the tunes now 👍👍Review after 3 .onths use.Must have device at home.A nice personal assistant to tell d you and entertain you with automation .Nice if you want to develop any habit  it reminds you to follow .Scheduled morning om chantings and prayers daytime songs etc so much inbuiltThe far field voice recognition doesn\\'t work very well with this echo device. The Echo spot did this job much better. Audio quality is not comparable to bluetooth speakers at the same price point, however it does one thing and does that well, which is Alexa integration. It\\'s a joy to have Alexa plan your day and remind you of things that would go on to save your life ! Thanks Alexa! Not much thanks to the audio quality :)It doesn\\'t listen maxium times, limited to few apps and most time it goeso n to a red mode where it says wifi problem or it can\\'t understand. So him many times sin this world I should keep saying alexa alexa... It fails to understand commands properly and this setup issue. Mmn then to connect to my cel phone Bluetooth was another saga. N now again it\\'s not connecting.I think those who want a good speakers should go for JBL, harman or bose or other brands with just manual Bluetooth option and not waste money in thisEverything is great about the product.Sometimes it doesn\\'t find what it can be. Overall it is a great product to keep at home.A big thanks to its Hindi version. My mom gets up early in morning and asks it to play Bhajans and it makes the morning more beautiful. No battery drainage worries and no worries of typing and finding any particular song on phone. It\\'s simple, Just ask.I want to make sure it needs 24/7 power supply, wifi and amazon prime subscription.Just awesome but one thing is missing that is google skill due to which most of the time it say I don\\'t know in case of searching something difficult thing otherwise other features are greatShe listens to Vishnu Sahasranamam and Suprabhatam everyday. While cooking and doing house work, she loves that she just has to say \"Alexa, play Vishnu Sahasranamam\". Great product for ease of use and quality of voice outputLike you Alexa...nice user friendly,obeying n orders regarding playing music n if we appreciate it is saying thanks if we scold Alexa it is calm not saying anything...hahah... enjoying AI...Alexa babyCons:Alexa is not  saying hi to my baby...I mean it won\\'t repeat what we said...it only plays music...This is my second alexa device. This is one of the best device for smart home for such a affordable price as 2000 Rs along with wipro smart light. Must buy. No cons except a few more advancements in the software which can be addressed in future.You whisper it whisper backs and the sound quality is just incredible and gets really really loud and voice recognition is best there is better than siri but can improve.and the amount of things you can do with it is incredible. Morning routine,evening routine,alarms,reminders, just seamless. All this provided you have stable wifi.The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0Mindblowing purchase in every respect.Awesome Device.1 Amazing Sounds Quality2 Great Performance3 Bluetooth Connectivity Fast4 Thanks a lot Amazon India5 Voice Control100% RecommendedHare KrishnaI have been using Echo Plus (1st Gen) since launch and wanted one more so got this one. I have Google Home too but it is not as good as Alexa.  99.9 % Alexa recognises my speed voice and 100% of my family members to control Smart Lights , Fire Stick and into. Planning to get Echo Show as well.Ordered during great indian sale. Upon starting,  not at all turning on. factory reset unresponsive. Rereplacement requested. will review once i received it.The sound quality is decent not too loud or low. The voice recognition ability of this device is 80 %. Whatever we want to get it hear from this device like any music or song, we have to repeat many times to get correct song. I think there is need to get improvement.Its not good as compared to older versions..I own the first version of it and it was awesome in taking commands and can recognise my voice from far like a charm.. But this one many a times don\\'t recognise my voice even if i am sitting next to it.. Not happy.. This device have other flaws also.. Like while playing next song..it actually doesn\\'t stop the song playing for like 2 seconds..Initially I thought it would helpful to control my redmi TV but later I came to know only mi 5x tv will support alexa. Even alexa is not finding my tv.Other than as AI it\\'s too good .especially for kidsNice product to have especially when it comes with a deal. A good time pass and although it might have many other features I liked it for songs and lighting smart bulbs😜Sound tends to get distorted at max volumeIntegration is easyCan be more user friendly and Hindi commands should be increased.Voice recognition excellentOverall a nice productPurchase if you get a deal😛Previously I posted \\'NA\\' . But now I\\'m editing my comment that is Alexa isvone my best partner when I alone in home., Using daily since I got it. I love it😍. And one more thing I\\'m using its original voice instead of AmitG.She is best friend for those people who are staying alone or have limited friend circle.I have received my alexa today (27 Dec 2021), but I am unable to set my echo dot alexa mobile application, I have contacted cust care but they said today is same problem in india wide but I am still confused if the device has malfunction or really the Amazon Alexa app facing the issue? I want reply from Amazon, thanksYes, in just 9 months, the speakers are crackling. I have placed a complaint and it will be replaced. But now I am very doubtful about the quality. If it happens again after 8-9 months, there will not be warranty to cover it.And Alexa App is the worst app on my iPhone.Looks like it is designed by developers with 0 UX knowledge and it is very buggyI have tried both Google and Alexa devices. And in my opinion, I cannot guarantee the future but till now, Amazon smart devices are much better than google in daily life usage.I was debating whether to buy the Amazon Echo Dot.  I am so glad that I did.  My day is now one long musical day - also being connected to most of my equipment is a bonus.  ThanksI dislike due to there is no Marathi language so add it marathi also while seeking in Maharashtra so add itGood and help full device,you can only connect the internet on useing time and install the Alexa app on your mobile,it is a comment base automatically device,sound quality is verry beautiful,but you can not carry for this device because it direct charge not inbuilt battery,prise is standard.you can connect it also blutooth without internet and play all downloaded movies and song in your mobile phone.Given 4 based in below initial points:Package doesnt have air packets where expecting proper packageIt says 4th generation but still not having aux cable  charging optionPros:Sound clarity really good(go for it if you are music lover)Almost recognise all voicesMy day start with this device I bought it 3 months ago.I really love this product.This product really amazing and the way controls wireless thing surprising.Everything working perfectFew things has to be developed.Few old songs won’t be recognised, I request please focused on this.Mind blowing purchase......😀😀😀😀Need to improve n skills....... I am a music lover from kerala.... So try to add more tracks from regional languages........ Otherwise try to link with youtube to get full range of songs from all lqnguages.....The Amazon Echo Dot... a good product... able to understand most of the voice commands... the sound quality is good...Bought it during the Amazon sale...Was actually looking for a blue tooth speaker, when the sale came up...and saw the Dot on sale..paid 1999/- for it... Working fine so far... The only con is, works only when plugged into a power outlet and there is no battery backup...Voice recognition is very bad and does not recognise the words for at least 50% of the time. Integration is good.. does not cause any problems while integrating. Half of the time very popular songs also are not recognised by Alexa. No settings to store the language preferences. All the time you have to choose which language you want to hear the songsAbout voice recognition , Alexa integration I would say, it is fine but as compared to bose this echo dot lags behind but over all this is not bad at this budget price. What One thing I want to point out is, it cannot recognise if it is requested to play a particular song or album unlike Amazon music app. This lacking has to be resolved. So I am giving 4 star.I got it during the time of sale. I have used google mini after using google I thought to upgrade it and check how is Alexa. It is good as well as bad from from google in different term. Alexa has better far field recognition but I think in order to save money amazon have made some cut offs  from Alexa 2nd generation. It literally understand what we say 6 times out of 10 times.Well its a overall good package for it\\'s price range.Sound is awesome 10/10.Nice speaker. Voice recognition is fine. It keeps us busy.sound quality is marvellous. Only problem I get that after power failure this device take long time to reconnect with the wifi. More over, wifi changing process is a bit difficult.It is unable to find things from Google even it can\\'t find songs or stories from Google. It only works when i connect it with Spotify aap. Then what is the use of this alexa. Spotify and other aaps are in my ph, then why i need to buy this alexa. It never work with Google. It never search things by own with the help of Google. It needs aap like Spotify and other aaps.Good product superficiallly if you expect to work as youtube or google you will be disappointed but yea ask time, reminder alarm news few popular songs its ok....had it worked as google or youtube man I would have given it a 5 starAlexa Pairs easily, acts as a nice bluetooth speaker. Sound is awesome specially bass. I owe a 2nd gen echo amd take my word 3rd gen echo is n times better than last in sound quality. Worthy successor.Special thanks to Amazon for quick replacement of my echo device.Only thorn in the foot is software. Sometimes fail to search desired music.Please don\\'t purchase it shows you are not eligible to purchase amit ji voice due to geographical restrictions.Alexa is one step to get information of whatever you want. Its voice recognition is also good, can go sometimes confused. The problem I have is, its not wireless, it has to be continously plugged in at a corner. Plus there are few features which needs upgradation, for eg maths calculation. Some math calculations alexa couldn\\'t do. Overall satisfied with the productEchod dot is an excellent smart speaker which feels very useful. Got it for 2299 with wipro smartbulb in prime day sale and its a good deal. Voice recognition is good enough and speaker sound quality is as good as can be expected at this size.. over-all a high quality product from amazonWorked on first day. Stopped to work from second day. Tried all steps in vain. Not satisfied with the product. Going to return the productCheated by amazon. I had ordered this product on the prime day sale and this is what amazon does for their prime customers. I just received a box which was already opened. The alexa itself wasn\\'t present inside the box only the charger was there inside. Worst service never expected this by amazon.Poor finishing of the product. Not expected from Amazon. Working is normal .Not at all satisfied with the finishing...that is reason for 3-stars rating.Just a decent piece. Not much appreciated. What worked perfectly is:1. How is weather2. When is sunset3.play music : mostly can\\'t understand which music you said and will end up playing some random.4. Setup alarmsApart from that you can just use it as a speaker in a corner of your room.PS: still few features were quite good but as i said it can\\'t understand commands at first attempt nor the second attempt. :PNice but not user FriendlyAmazing product in such a price tag. I bought this in Prime Day deal so got 2 in 4k. I already have an echo device, the bigger one and these two were for my parents and in-laws, they are super happy and excited. Anyone looking to gift something nice to their near one... Got for it...Very Good. Kids in home liked it very much. sometimes facing issue in voice recognition. if movie name is common word in multiple languages, it is mixing the thing\\'s up.Clear sound.Beautiful replies from AlexaAstonishing microphoneBeautiful ring ligth notificationsControlling smart home immediatelyLove itThe media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0Good for the price but sometimes while playing the song she doesn\\'t responds me ......and yes those who think that there will be a Amitabh bacchan voice then the ans is no as you have to buy his voice for 99 rs/- overall it is a good product and the bulb is also good quality takes up every command😁😁Best 👍💯 AI ever used!Sound quality is damn cool!I order alexa from my hall to bedroom yet she listen (don\\'t judge I have big area)Most favorite part is, before ordering it my mom  thought it\\'s waste of money and now she talk with her more than she talks with me.I ordered alexa in diwali sale, I received it along with smart wifi bulb 💡 which makes it more interesting. Now I am looking to buy more smart stuff to connect with alexa.Don\\'t buy this product if you are planning to home theater feeling, instead you can go with best soundbar with sound... and this product ia simply a Waste of money.I have been using this product for 3 days now and this is the best smart Bluetooth speaker i have ever come across. The only con i and most people would feel that it has to be plugged in all the time for the use, probably in the future it will come with a chargable battery. Looking forward for that.Overall a decent buy...but for full benefits u hv to purchase voice recognised device like fire stick...smart plugs smart lights etc... i got ome echo dot 3rd gen n one wipro smart bulb in 2299 ...n happy wid d product ...I have been using from a year almost... Just amazing for all your day to activities, controlling bedroom (lights, AC, Fan) to many other appliances. Connect to Laptop, Mobile, and enjoy.This is my second purchase.It would be great if it can communicate using other Asian and European languages.Sometimes when I ask to play music, it will start all over from the radio DJ comments. And keeps playing the same music.Doesn\\'t know much about books in other language. I thought it can help me with my studies of other languages such as German and asked to read me a German book, but it doesn\\'t know it.When it comes to music also it doesn\\'t know any other language music. Need improvement in that area as well.The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0Completely original no problem. Even if you find any problem in the beginning then you can replace itAlexa hardware is good, Alexa heard from far away , sound quality is good, light effects are good. But search or informational datase is limited when comes to questions or local regional places.Horrible integration with apps. It cannot play songs requested. Thought some of the songs are available in gaana it\\'s always integrating with Amazon music where there are not many songs.Sound bass is good but it doesn\\'t support YouTube music and support only hungama and savvan music app by which it doesn\\'t play all songs which we want. Google home is much better cause it support YouTube music by which we can play any song and play religious shabad bani which we need so I recommend to buy Google home.Don\\'t buy this product. Totally waste of money. It has many glitches. It stopped working within 10 days. Called to Amazon for replacement but they denied to replace.Every time i called they gave different opinions. They are not on same page.One of the best product witch can you buy on Amazon. The performance of alexa is good. But I didn\\'t get access to Amazon prime music don\\'t know why. Songs are playing on Hungama it makes me feel like se Hungama product not amazon\\'s. And sometimes it give you add before playing music. Music have to be played on Amazon prime which should be the first priority on this deviceI liked the Product. But I realized after using it for a while that when i was using it initially i could see a light on device like blue orange green  in different colors for  alert reminder etc. basically would give the status. But I am unable to see that now. I tried other options in settings through App but no success. I called Customer care for replacement they mentioned I already passed the date and Can\\'t do anything about it.Another super productive item from Amazon Alexa. I love to use it.. well connected with all my smart devices like bulbs, TV etc. Always find some fun while useing it... Best sound quality... We hope in future it may support Telugu language also... waiting for this updateMain Sanjeev Kumar. main echo dot third generation + Wipro smart bulb purchase Kiya Hai. Amazon Prime dwara 1999 rupees main. 29 September ko book kiya tha aur ek October ko morning mein hi Mujhe mil gaya tha. iska sound Bada Hi Shandar hai aur Wipro bulb bhi bahut Achcha kam kar raha hai. Maine se 5 star rating Di Hai very nice product.It started hanging after 3 to 4 days but i thought it may be network issue but the problem is same and now it needs set up again and again and set up is fail again and again so  i am fed up with this product alexa app is also very slowSo i would nor recommend this productWastage of moneyWorst product ever, Bluetooth connectivity very poor. Only purchase if you want to know whether condition or any score other than that its literally just waste of moneyAlexa can do just anything!!You can even operate echo(even book a ride) with your phone switched off ,only the WiFi needs to be on.once setup, echo is on its own....it does not need a phone ... just a WiFi connectionSet reminders, many alarms, birthday reminders,and do everything possible on this device which is just a little larger than a tennis ball.Not at all a good software.. terrible at voice recognition.. most of the time it will get you frustrated trying to play the music you want.. it only understands a set of pre configured commands correctly.. no AI whatsoever.. even the sound quality is equivalent to a bluetooth speaker one thirds it\\'s price..My previous one had stopped working after 6months. They replaced the item immediately.The return was done, via me buying a new device and then getting refunded for the amountAlexa is good. It understands the query well now. For conversation mode you need to train Alexa.You can change call sign of Alexa but there are only 4 options available. Bought in 2019 for Rs 1650/-. Now going to buy another on 26/07/2021 for Rs2249/-.So satisfying. Packing was good.  Product also reach in one piece. I think words can not explain the quality of the product but star rating can.Super purchase at affordable price of Rs . 1999 bundled with free wipro smart light.Fast response,  crystal clarity sound, innovative control of 3rd party smart appliances & beautifully designed.Very much reccomended.Very easy to control music.She sings at your command...rather plays songs!! Plays quizzes with you....plays radio stations, wakes you u with music and much much more . What I dislike about her is her very annoying female Indian accent voice. I wish I could set it to British or USA English.The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0It\\'s really worth buying, I have google home as well so I realised the capabilities of alexa. It would definitely recommend to go with alexa if you are planning to buy assist.It has really great fallback prompt if it doesn\\'t recognise what we said, it also immediately recognises the smart devices added.I have no words how good this device is. Super happy with the deal that Amazon offered during it\\'s prime day sale, got it at an amazing price along with a 12W smart bulb. The sound quality of the speaker is beyond basic and average. Trust me no speaker can give you a quality like this one and with the integration of a Smart Assistant in it makes it an icing on the cake. Best deal i have got till date. Thank you Amazon.I find it very handy. Very good assistant at home. The more I understand Alexa skills the more I find it useful. Overall I do not regret my buy. Instead of China I wish Amazon makes it in India to make all Indians happy.Alexa is going to eat up your brain with its chatty mode (non-working brief mode). I tell her to play a song and before i get to enjoy it, she states the song title, all the singer names (can be 2,3 or 4) and the source (amazon music, aaple musicor jio saavn). Pretty annoying if you ask me. Refund initiated.Bought this with high hopes that it would be intelligent to automate a lot of things. but it isn\\'t really that smart. the most we use it for is to play songs.The product is nice but I don\\'t know why the sound seems to be muddy... I have listened to another same ECO dot which i had brought from my friend for testing the sound. This piece given to me is definitely having some issue with sound.I couldn\\'t use it as it was a faulty one and didn\\'t get connected to wifi and I returned and bought a refurbished one which is working fine.Overall product is ok ok type.Can\\'t respond to many of commands, it only response to some predefined commands especially when asked to play songs on it.Not upto mark as compared to Google home in case of response and voice detection.Built quality and sound quality is better than Google home.So,my 1 month experience says, it is not so bad and at the same time not too good.Excellent product with very good voice recognition. Sound quality is equally good and sufficient for 2bhk house.The only con and I think the most important vital thing absent is that it works only when you plug it to power. It is not wireless.Probably the next generation should have thisif you love music and spend most of the time making home and importantly in the kitchen, with the busy hands to change the music, set the timer, correct measurements for recipe and so much more it will come handy. i mean i love it so much that i want to get more and gift it to everyone i know.Excellent device. I found this device is boon for senior citizens like me. It is awesome for youth to enjoy unlimited skills, routines. Its doing wonderful job by voice, routines like light operation, play music in scheduled time. I am very impressed with its remote controlling. We can operate lights, music with mobile phone app.Happy with sound quality. Not required amazon prime. I\\'m using it free without any subscriptions.For 1500 sqft home Alexa dot is a perfect device we don\\'t need additional speakers.Clever answers collection. I have attached one smart bulb with this and it is well controlled by Alexa.OVERALL VALUE OF MONEY PRODUCT MUCH BETTER THAN GOOGLE MINI :)Nothing exceptional about it. Average sound quality. Actually it\\'s waste of money. Alexa integrates to very limited apps and that too from Amazon only. It\\'s made in china and Amazon is intentionally hiding it.Lovely lovely lovely thank you Amazon for this wonderful product. I mainly use this product for testing my own developing alexa skills. Anway outstanding product. Its always stand one step ahead than Google Home.....Stopped connecting to WIFi after 2 weeks of use , and not connecting to WIFi at all even other devices are working well with same routerThe sound quality is great but some answers for the question isn\\'t good but, in most of the question google smart speaker gives the appropriate answers while Alexa only tells result from the web. I would love to have answers like google assistance.if you have more of the echo and amazon products this is gonna rock you\\'ll get the best out of itI was excited to get a smart device for the first time. But Disappointed I was able to connect first and was exploring things by then had auto disconnect and tried multiple times to connect it was not happening. My bad I have to return the product. 😢Half the time it doesn\\'t recognise.. half the time it doesn\\'t have that song to play.. and it never let me enable follow up mode.. Google nest mini is much betterMy Alexa echo for is not responding to my voice command.Till setup everything was ok.But not responding to any of my voice commandGood product..initially ordered for Rs.3499 and on the same day suddenly reduced to 2999 by the same seller. Canceleld the first order immediately and ordered for 2999. But today at independence day sale it is just available for 2000. Configuration to our network and setup is tedious.but I managed..the process needs to be even more simple..The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0Sometimes it just freezes. And plays something else. Google is smarter. But the sound of alexa is betterNice product, but they have less options in terms of music like devotional and other like you tube. Although comparison with youtube is not perfect. As youtube plateform is run on users based and collection.It won\\'t work without power. Voice is slow. Wifi is compulsory. Otherwise Alexa won\\'t work. Not at all user friendly. Returned itThe media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0Didn\\'t know why some times it\\'s behaving like too noisy and scratching sound, happened quite a lot of times since I brought it but restarting it fixes the problem, but experience wise I didn\\'t expected this from Amazon products disappointed 😞.Things to improve:1. Please allow phones to play any music via alexa speaker. Atleast add option to \\'Play this song on echo dot\\' to Amazon play.2. Add feature to schedule activities. Like play this song after 2 minutes or play this song everyday at 5AM. Similarly, turn on light after 1hour or turn off light after one hour.Echo dots across rooms transfoms them to smart rooms.Without Echo in a room it\\'s simply inhabitableThe product is good but the main drawback is it doesn\\'t have inbuilt battery and we cannot use this speaker while travelling.If this product has the below feature than i would have given 5 on 51. Battery backup.2. Make calls to everyone doesn\\'t matter the other person have Alexa.3. Aux connectivity.The product can\\'t do much more than playing songs , it fails to tell distance , meaning , song search is awafull , fail to search article on internet, skills don\\'t work . I was very excited to buy alexa after seeing advertisement on internet but I  really very disappointed after receiving it.The voice recognition was excellent as usual like other Alexa devices,the sound quality is better compared to other portable speakers.although the setting up process is  bit annoying if we didn\\'t order it from our Amazon account.But overall still it\\'s a excellent one...Alexa does pretty much all the job, sound quality is good, Microphone is good not the best. It does most of the job, but it lacs lot of knowledge as it is depended upon Wikipedia, if its not mentioned in wikipedia it wont answer. IF u ask it How are u, it always gives a std reply, which is bit irritating..It most of time blinks orange color to indicate it is waiting for a command word and we arent using it, which is a kind of spying.I got this product in offer basis, product is good. But 2 issues I found: one is Alexa is not recognising the voice clearly and second one is she is not playing correctly what we are asking... They might be sent me a refurbished item, actually before that I don\\'t know reg these issues before I saw my friends Alexa(Echo dot).. Really I am not satisfied on this product.Product is pretty good in other words it is awesome I am using this daily for streaming songs and weather forecast. Easy to install and easy access Bluetooth.Even my kids uses it to access rhymes. Thanks to AMAZONBut coming  to delivery it is too bad recently I have ordered two units in which I have received one and other one is not delivered till now customer care says that my products is in damage condition that is the reason it is not delivered.very unworthy reason from amazon Being a very big reputed company. I though of gifting it to my friend on 03-Oct-2019 as it was his bday but you people have disappointed me.It\\'s very helpful for me I have to order sme thing I don\\'t have to use my pn I have to only say\\'alexa buy that \\'\\'i have to say alexa turn on Wipro bulp \\'\\'i have to sy alexa turn on smart switchThe sound quality is only average but gets the job done. Gets pretty loud though.If you listen to a lot of music using a Bluetooth speaker or something, in that case this becomes a great replacement. Smart + convenient.Worth a shot for sure!I am very happy with this device as it has made my life easier, feel good to upgrade. The Bluetooth connection is good and the mic is really as mentioned in the product description. In short its a must buy device and oh yes I got this device to connect with the TCL 55 P series tv. Will connect it and come review againIntegration takes too much time. Doesn\\'t understand a lot of stuff and worst part is it needs to be connected all the time. Unable to connect to my mi smart android tv.Too much time and energy needs to be put in to set it up with anything. Not worth it.Bought This For ₹2.5k And I Feel It\\'s Good Enough For That Price Though. 2 Days Into It And There\\'s Pretty Much Every Integration You Can Imagine Of! This Is Also My First Step Towards Home Automation And I\\'ll Love To Do That In Future.Using it since Oct 2019. I am happy with the product.There is scope for improvement in voice recognition. Some intelligence is required in the product when you ask for regional language music.I bought this device for 2k in prime sell. I am quite impressed with it.Below are the pros -1. Easy set up in 5 mins2. Integration with Airtel , Syska, Hungama, Wipro,Savan .. etc apps was was quite easy . Didn\\'t face single issue.3. Sound is crystal clear and pleasing4. Looks amazingAnd many more..Cons - I couldn\\'t find any.Great product and really I didn\\'t expect that small speaker can have such a strong bass and great sound and also loud enough that can be headed from down stare . Really a great one.Amazon should update these devices to enable it to use any open wi fi or hor spot. Otherwise you may need a dedicated wifi router or always available mobile phone. If both goes down Alexa goes down. Why to stick on a network, let it use any open wifi.Lady Alexa is 3rd gen,no more a kid,she is young ,can\\'t go blild in a men\\'s world at her prime young age,time.She should have Four Way eye sight to see and observe.Am I right dear ?I love her very much.I presented Eco Dot to my grand daughters . They are very happy & satisfied with it . They say that it is the best gift since now .  Now I am planning to buy for me to listen old & new  songs as well . In Deepawali sale I got this for 2500 ₹ with smart bulb . I am waiting for another sale .  Sarita MishraOne of the Best purchases. Sound Quality is Superb. Inexpensive. Alexa remains the best voice ecosystem for smart home control. Only con: It is not up to google assistant level while answering broad information queriesPortability is poor because it’s a wired device and doesn’t work without the power cord. Should have had batteries option too in which case one could call them portable. That said all other features are modern and quite useful too.Not that user friendly, infact. Many times it fails to understand our request and mainly cannot recognize kannada language movie songs..But voice recognition is good and other informations are well casted.. need more updates and should introduce all regional languages aeap.The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0This was launched on 11th and I got the product by 12th. Plus the reduced price due to sale and a nice smart bulb for just 500 rupees. Overall I think this was super value for money. I haven\\'t used any other smart speaker before but I am very happy with my purchaseA must buy product but I’ll suggest buying while discount going on because I find it lil expensive but still it worth buying anyway 👍🏻👍🏻 My 6 year kid enjoys talking to alexa & playing songs on on it. My whole family loves it.This Alexa (echo dot) is super smart and it has sophisticated technology,if you have fire tv it is the best you can control the tv with your voice and it recognizes your voice perfetly. You can also play so many games with it and it is best for kids. You can also buy a smart lights to control it with your voice. It almost has every question you ask, you can also ask it to say a story or play music and much moreThe media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0Crisp and clear sound with lots of fun.... I am loving itA great speaker love the sound.... And impressive voice recognitionCould do a tad better on the Alexa software as it takes location from the language you set also particular language settings only work with a particular skill... Also a youtube cast skill would be greatA great device. Not only making my experience of listing to music better but also helping my child in learning English better. Also has many skills which are making life easy and helping kid learning and exploring new stuff. Also got at an amazing price during the sale. :)Ok, ok...i dint the product much. It needs a lot of tuning and improvement in terms of features and intelligence. Not a smart device. :(Had a little trouble adding the device to my Amazon account but that\\'s probably because my WiFi was acting up. The product itself is great. The sound is pretty loud for such a small thing. The Alexa integration works fine. No complaints so far.It\\'s a very nice product. I ordered it during the big billion day Sale. I got a wipro smart bulb free with it. The speaker sound is loud and clear. Don\\'t go by its size, it produces sound loud enough to fill a small room. And the sound is very clear too. Alexa feature is also very helpful. I have bonded a smart bulb with it, which was very to easy to do. Just follow the instructions given in the instruction manual that comes with the product and all will be done without a hassle. Overall, a very nice product. Thank u Amazon.The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0Nice Products But Not Google Add in Google Add to Your Alexa Add to Google in All Information In Each Others Aap Information By the by Sach A Voice Smart Spaker  Very Nice Alaxa  Spaker 3ed Ganration Brand By Amazon Brand Amazing Voice Product Nice Buy it a 6 Days Very Beautiful VoiceThis is my first Alexa product. Got it for 1999 with a free 9 W Wipro smart bulb. At this price the combo was superb. IF you have weak wi fi connection then it will give some trouble otherwise go for it without a second doubt.The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0I have completely satisfied with the product and it\\'s been nearly two months back i purchased it and I didn\\'t found any drawbacks, Thanks.When You have alexa U never Ever feel alone as you can interact with Alexa And do tons of things like Listen to music.. news... weather forecast and many more... Alexa hindi Has so many good and very funny responses.. its kind of becomes your routine to talk to alexa... For sound quality i will say Its 4.5/5 star as the sound quality is amazing and can fill a room easily...Most of the times it doesn\\'t recognize what u meant.plus u need a subscription to use amazon music .thankfully I had apple music subscriptionSo first looking at echo dot I thought it would be very small but the size is very good and sound is also very superb.Just the AI if you ask some questions it will not answer as crisp and clear which you get in Google otherwise for the entertainment this is the best and connectivity is also very easy.Alexa becomes a family member even before you know it. The sound quality and ability to integrate with one’s daily life at home is awesome. From info on the weather to traffic snarls... we’ve come to depend on this bright new companion.The product is very good and compatible with almost anything.i ve connected my bedroom moodlighting wth alexa and i can turn on\\\\off, change colors.And i can control many other devices and the audio quality i really good.Value for money, affordable virtual assistant. Crystal clear sound. Bass is good. Very responsive mic. Overall satisfied with the product from Amazon!Everything is good but the calling feature is asking to install the Alexa app on other phones too it\\'s quite difficult for everyone so we couldn\\'t able to make a call 🤷\\u200d♀️Being a prime member at Amazon is necessary, otherwise the product is unable to play music and popular songs. The sound quality is ok. Some instructions are hard for it to follow. Eg Alexa give us an applause.It plays out nice music but it found it hard to connect smart bulbs.  I bought Halonix smart bulb. It recognized the bulb but can\\'t control it.1. Had to scream or stand very close to it then only it heard the command.2. It was playing 2 songs at the same time3. Sound quality was very poorमुझे इतना पसंद नहीं आई अलेक्सा मुझे उतना अच्छा नहीं लगा आप आप सिर्फ इस पर गाना सुन सकते हैं कुछ पूछ सकते हैं इसके अलावा और कुछ नहीं कर सकतेGood quality product.Good sound quality. Not compared with jbl or sony speakers but better than boat.Well it\\'s not just a bluetooth speaker its smart.Alexa is very interactive it takes a bit time to update skills in alexa and then you can have alot of fun. It also has a aux output port you can connect any sound system for better sound.Purchased in a loot offer for 1229.. Awesome for d price I paid.. Not worth if yo pay more than one thousand five hundred... My kid njoyyinh with it... Setup was very very easy..njoyyinh with free led bulb.. Sound quality is average..bt connectivity is good... Using it with mobile WiFi.. working well...Costliest than the quality . can we return it now?? as due to covid-19 Pandemic unable to process return of the device. all the packings are kept intact and even plastic over the product. kindly advice the procedure to return back now.Bought it in prime day salePros:Good sound quality considering sizeHas bluetoothHas aux outGood mics recognises whispers easily and whispers backCons:Too small in sizeNot value for moneyNot wirelessNot much smart functionNeeds good wifiHeats upI am totally bored , this device have crappy software and limited number of uses unlike its counterpart google mini. I made a terrible mistake buying it. I would love to return this if it weren\\'t for the return period being over.Not worth at all. Overall extremely poor performance & after sales.It\\'s a very good product but alexa must have some upgraded skills like voice lock and continuous conversation. I can\\'t have continued covo with alexa and that\\'s somewhat disappointing.I was so confused to buy it or not because there were many negative reviews but i decided to buy echo dot 3 gen, This is my first alexa device got delivered today just loving the sound and bass... Don\\'t care of negative reviews just buy... Its awesomeThis is a really expensive bluetooth speaker that happens to take voice commands to play songs and switch on and off the one smart bulb in my room. That\\'s for me, if you have a full home automation setup in your home, do buy it, it will be a good effective investment for the same.This not a smart speaker, most of time it will say ...\"Sorry i don\\'t know that\" or it will ask to refer amazon page for help.i will suggest Google smart speaker is much better alexa is just seems a scrap and more over alexa is just an amazon shopping tool to listen customers and suggesting them  products to buy.Good experience,Good sound quality,u can also operate ur smart gadgets with this....when u asked funny question to Alexa in Hindi....She replied in a funny way,that was soo interesting about this product andAt night when u talk in wishper,she replied in the same way....that was soo cool....i lik this product.Must buy it...Its always says invalid password while connecting to Android (Samsung) devices however its works on IOS devices. I have shared the screenshot with Amazon team but they barely reply. Highly disappointedFabulous product with such an easy of operation that my aged mother uses it seamlessly. Easily recognizes hindi language. In the morning she just commands it to play live gurbani and later in the day her favourite singer\\'s song.  No wires, no pairing with phones. Drop in feature is amazing too. It comes in handy at times when the phone is not nearby. All in all, an amazing product from amazon.follow up mode not working.tried every troubleshooting.May be my product had some bug.returning it.follow up mode is most important feature in Alexa for using on tv or day to day questions.Not always respond to ur voice when u give continuous command one after anotherall other things were working fine.Device recognises the call work but then freezes. Does not execute commands given to it. Worst purchase ever.It plays certain songs again and again, doesn\\'t let you skip. Recognition has also gone from bad to worst, you have to yell for Alexa to understand what you want it to do only for it to tell you it doesn\\'t understand what you said. And expect no support from Amazon about eco devices, it\\'s very bad.Was skeptical whether to buy it or not. But after the purchase feel so happy that I bought it because my daughter loved it a lot. She keeps interacting with ALEXA. Pluse Alexa makes some of your tasks easy. Just go for it.Alexa device is good I won\\'t say it is the best sometimes it doesn\\'t recognize the voice overall I would say it\\'s value for money as I purchased it for 1999 in offer with that I got a smart blub from wipro free in amazon sale.I liked the product very much and it has got great features.Only thing it is missing is Auto Audio Control. When it play music, many songs plays loud while many at low volume. Very annoying to ask Alexa to put volume low and high for each song.Waste of money. Pls do not spend on this. Hardly it recognizes the indian music channels, artists, movies etc..can  or connect with your smart phone..it can make calls only between alexa or to skype. Cant integrate with indian mobile sim.I bought it for music, making calls etc..waste of money.There is this huge interference in 2.4 GHz band while using Alexa it will screw up yur wifi speed for sure it u are not using a 5ghz wifi band really huge problem which needs to be fixed but sadly even there backend team can\\'t fix the issue and just blatantly as u to use a dual band router and use 5ghz for internetThere are few problem in connectivity but sound quality is excellent if u love listing music echo dot is brilliant .Eco dot is a fantastic smart speaker but being a music lover i wanted one thing that is if alexa had a option from which we can create play list.In starting I have find issue that alex didn\\'t able to recognize my voice but after sometime it was fixed. Now i am satisfied, i get in a fantastic product in great price....😍If you are looking for just a assitant its good otherwise if you are using at full time speaker sound wobble at high volumes and sound quality is not good no bass ! Or maybe i got a defected pcs dont know but have google nest using from 1year its better anyhow in sound quality then alexaIf you could grab a good deal at sale on Alexa , don\\'t miss out on it. You\\'ll love the sound quality as well as other skills that Alexa hasPlease add Sunday Suspense from Radio Mirchi Kolkata or YouTube as skills ( Popular Bengali audio stories), because my mother is completely blind and Alexa is helping with automation, I information, calling  and entertaining her a lot as Alexa is the only companion, when we go out for work, thank you Amazon, please try to upgrade.If you want any assistance regarding any new ideas, please fill free to call 9836363130I can\\'t added skills GAANA, JIO SAAVN, TAMIL NEWS CHANNELS, ZOMATO, TAMIL FM (all India radio) only available. Its take to listening alexa return the answer. Kindly request exchange this device? I will buy upgrade...Rated poorly because of issues in m facing the device is not functioning properly and amazon customer representative says we are a market place and we dont  take any responsiblity i will provide u contact nos of seller and i made a call to seller those numbers are switched offPathetic product. Never buy it. Took whole day for me just to setup pair with phone/tab. End of the day it didn’t. I am hugely disappointed. Will never buy any Amazon product. I simply wanted a Bluetooth speaker which is basic functionality of speaker that too not working.Product is good, using it for 15 days nowFlipkart delivery excellent,Lack of Voice recognition ,Don\\'t understand lot of thing and don\\'t have answers in lot of time,Once started answering anything won\\'t stop till it finished and won\\'t repond in-between if we call alexa several timesGood for kids. Playful tooNeed always strong and continue internet data network.Lovely one... Very glad to have this realy it\\'s awesome... Only one thing is that i ordered grey and received black... Please exchange with grey color... Otherwise nice device sound is ok for light music and and party music bit small... Thanks amazon love uThe media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0Alexa is quit irritating because it only understands 80%comands but its ok because after all its a robot....... hope new Updates will make her more and more accurate............ You should only buy it in sale 2300rs then its only a value for money product in 2300 I got Alexa and a Wipro bulb with it........ I am happy with the service also.We purchased our first Eco Dot from Amazon.Our family was very much excited to see how it works. But there is lots of issues with it. If your connection is lost ,than it will take lot of time to reconnect we have to switch it off and on Many times for reconnecting.  Sound recognition is very very poor.My suggestion is for Amazon ,sound recognition should be made for Indian accecent.....Awesome and Music quality very good. If you don\\'t have prime membership just set Gaana to your default music service from alexa app to listen music without ads.Doesn\\'t pick up command easy when it\\'s playing music, search results are inaccurate.. No option of battery.After receiving the device, had integration issue and later got to know from Amazon team that it was a known issue for them. Not sure why they still wanted to send the deviceI am happy to use this Alexa, i bought this is offer with a smart bulb. Bulb didn’t worked but Alexa rocked.The main disadvantage is it\\'s not portable and requires continous power supply and it\\'s not mentioned in product description. Sound quality is very poor. No bass. It\\'s just like playing songs in your mobile.Good for light speaker use, don\\'t expect a boom out of it. And yes, Alexa is awesome, but buy if you have use, don\\'t just go with the trend.I like this because whatever I tell to Alexa it listen. When you have to listen joke tell Alexa open hindi joke. When you have to listen song tell Alexa open best Bollywood/Hollywood song and it will open automatically. But when you purchase this product . At first you have to go in playstore and download Alexa app and other thing you have to do and it is necessary also. I thanks Amazon for making this type of product.  Thanks  From  🇮🇳The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0Really this product was amazing my experience very well with the my routine work Alexa remember me Alexa set the alarm in many more works play the songs in enjoy with usImage just for referenceAlexa is best in voice recognition and it says some times, sorry mujhe nehi patha which irritates me, the answers were simpleAlexa needs more improvements in hindi language and expecting it to be launched in regional languages too,Extreme happy is that I bgot it for just 1314 rupees onlyI know many of you will not believe 😂1. Voice recognition is poor esp with accompanying Wipro smart bulb.2. It frequently says that \"it is not able to connect to internet\" however it works fine after it is RESET. So the problem is not internet.It doesn\\'t have option to add major Indian music apps like Gaana, Jio Saavan and Wynk music apps. You can only link Amazon music, Apple Music and Spotify, so it\\'s very difficult if you already subscribed in these app. This is the major issue otherwise everything is too goodWon\\'t connect to the other devices, doesn\\'t link to my Amazon music just knows hungama music maybe due to tie up but didn\\'t think I would be using it for music purposes only as it\\'s useless in every other sense.. It\\'s better to have a speaker than an Alexa.I bought in Echo dot in sale its working for just one month after till this time its not yet connect with my wifi also its not user friendly. Feels like they rid of money its totally wasteWowBought for my family entertainment, purpose solved, enjoying with the product, sound quality satisfied, worth to buyVoice recognition is very good . Alexa integration requires future upgrades in its AI capabilities. Since, only specific phrases , that to in particular order would activate proper correct response. Sound quality is fairly good for such a small device.Who love technology this product is good for them & im happy with this product but it’s more interesting when you by other eco devices with it like WiFi switches, WiFi bulbsBeen using this for last 5 days.Setup was a breeze. Establishing connections was pretty simple...with minimal effort  connected to my Bose Mini II. Build quality is very basic... certainly has room for lots of improvement on that front.Bass levels are inadequate and hence the need for connecting to slightly  better speaker Bose.However my need was to get onto the Alexa Ecosystem ... so very basic speaker is something i could live with.this product is great, sure there are sometimes she cant answer but most of the times she can,she can play music, answer alot of questions and if you have smart devices like fire tv then alexa can on them by command.thats why i recommend you to buy it.Ans for a fixed question only,unable to give ans for all question,I ask where is chittorgarh fort, the ans is i don\\'t know.its not self learning aiProduct done very well for up to on month. But when I deregistered for some problemAfter that it is not connecting to jio fi network.please help meIt doesn\\'t recognise the voice everytime and it makes me repeat multiple times before I get what I asked for. Overall sound is nice but sometimes it gets low automatically. And for most of the things it has only one answer which is \" I don\\'t know\". I expected much more from it. Google works more precise than Alexa.This product is high quality material and high technology. Very easy setup for smart home and fire TV stick.Poor collection of songs.Poorly bifurcates songs as per year, playback singerwe had received one earlier and now bought the second one. the sound is very good and alexa also responds well. one can good net connectivity else it may not work.Build quality and design is good.But Google services like YouTube cannot be linked.This is the major drawback.But AI programming for alexa is highly genius.Totally waste of money product as I received... Alexa not recognised my voice properly. Always need a wifi connection with excellent network to work Alexa. 👎🏻 Not recommend to buy this. You can go with Google assistant speaker instead of this.Using from almost a year now . Perfectly fine in sound quality and voice recognition. I recommend this if you love listening music  and to operate smart devices. But sadly it doesn\\'t give proper answer if you ask general knowledge.Set it up and started to command Alexa to do my bidding. Son and missus also love it. The sound quality surprised me coming from a small speaker. Tried to connect with a bluetooth speaker but not successful. There is a learning curve that must be tackled though.  The test drive will go on for some more time. But so far so good.I bought this for my small home and it is working very effectively. Only thing is that I couldn’t figure out how to connect my Samsung tv with Alexa. The sound quality and voice recognition is very goodThis is the third Alexa I have.  It’s Mike is very good and the speaker quality is also awesome. Definitely worth every rupee. Go for it.One of the best gadgets which you should keep at home.Amazin quality and sound performance. Easily integration and thanks for a lot of features you can use. Good Work Amazon, Nice Product, I would recommend for this device so you can see how Machine Learning will change our future and this is what we will see in next 5 years every year.Initially difficult to connect it later I ve seen the video from you tube... After connection it works good.. Nice product.. Don\\'t know about the long-term useIt\\'s good product as per the expectation if you are new for this kinda thing, but need to improvise on the voice recognition part , It\\'s a catch if you are not good at acsent of the linguistic language hoping to speak.At beginning it was amazing. Later I\\'m just using it for music and news nothing else.Its quite handy if you want to know something quickly.The product is very good...... But there is not much u can do with it right now..... Just some news, music n light operations tats allSmart homes are a long way to come by.Some times need to call the name Alex multiple times as she would not respond. Other than that it\\'s fine.“First impression is last impression” really echo is a best companion of all time...  sound really good rich bass treble everything what you need to rock the floor....Really appreciate you people work behind of this project..Really amazon cheersGood product... bought it during EOSS for around 1999/- make sure you buy whenever the product is cheaper than the regular price... wait for amazon big sale period...Good one. Go for it.Sound quality is excellent but without internet  it is usless. Its not even wireless or battery operated that is one of its main cons....Its not worth buying.....the device was ok for 1 year. then one random day it failed to connect to wifi/bluetooth. talked to customer care they declared it defective. warranty expired.Alexa is dumb when compared to Google Home. I think I made a mistake by buying this. Instead should have gone for other AI assistant available in the market.The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0Superb..When the music is playing on the Echo dot, it doesn\\'t always pick up the call word. You\\'ll have to be either close to it or speak loudly. Other than that the product is really good. Sound quality is also pretty good. Will update this after a month of use.How to detect charging is on or off..it is not showing any light while plugin... It show only for few seconds then disappears.Ain\\'t very responsive to the voice commands and the quality of sound reproduction and accoustics is sub-par to say the least.When i purcahsed Redmi TV, i was told that it get connected to Redmi TV, but i was unable to connect it, when contacted the amazom customer care on how to set this up with, they were unable to help me, morever they promised a call back which never happenedThe best product. Many times I thought that blessed that amazon giving service in our timeamazon Echo Dot (3rd) gen is working as expected to the extent now I am thinking why did not I buy the next gen with videoThe sound quality is good however I found 2 cons in this.1. You always need to connect speaker with plug else it wont work. There is no battery back up2. Alexa would not get everything you say most of the time so you end up choosing to select your song sometime manually rather than giving command to alexa.The new 3rd Generation echo dot is not as good as Amazon claims...I think 2nd generation is better than 3rd generation in almost all aspects mic being the top most... You can\\'t use it more than 10 feets away but 2nd generation I am using that 20 feets or more.I need to call alexa atleast 4 times, then it will response onceEcho Dot is the best home personal assistant at this price range. Alexa listens to whatever you ask her to do and does the task excellently. I am highly impressed by this device.1) There was an ongoing issue happening with the Wipro smart light not getting paired with the echo device.\\u200bHere is the case ID: 03036247912) voice Search accuracy is not good.Nice product I loved it very much it has made my life happier by listening to various songs and musicEcho Dot recognise your voice well , good at playing music , alarm and reminding important thing to you . There\\'s a little problem It always in search of songs as i asked For a GK question . Is you are a student and want help in study its not for you then !Excellent sound quality..l am enjoying. Coudnt expect such wonderful sound from a small device like echo dot 3rd gen. I got it in a bundle offer with syska smart bulb. That too has delighted me.Amazing product.Pros:Amazing voice recognitionGood sound qualityEasy to installCons:Amazon needs to improve on Alexa skills.Need more Alexa skills.Connecting to non amazon products is bit tricky.Overall a worthy product.Totally unnecessary in life! But once you have it, it becomes kinda difficult to live without it 😀😀Alexa mostly understands everything, but still there are some simple things that she wasn\\'t able to search and get results. Like i asked who is General M M Narvane. But she wasn\\'t able to tell anything. Not even she told anything about current Navy Chief. These are some loopholes. But other than that i have found her amazing overall on every aspect.It required lots of improvement. Like it is not that much features like Google Assistant has. Voice recognition issue. But not very bad. It has lots of good things also like we can use as bluetooth speaker and sound quality.Worst smart speakers in the market ... after a few weeks its sound became noisey and distorted .. unbearable. And they will not even replace it . Please avoid if possibleThe media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0The echo dot i recieved doesn\\'t deserve a single star. I am trying to turn on but it\\'s not working. Wosrt experience and destroyed the expectations.Please Always test the product at lab or somewhere before making deal with customer.I would not recommend it. Ordered it and it\\'s been almost 1 month now. It doesn\\'t detect even if you call it multiple times. Doesn\\'t understand basic commands like pause, stop. Doesn\\'t respond.Very disappointed, hope had ordered Google Mini insteadGood productI don\\'t think it takes music and other stuff from google or youtubeMost of the music is from hungama music or jio savanVoice recognition is averageAlso tells us the weather,temperature,air quality and also sets alarms and stuffWe can play a bunch of games tooI like it as my first smart speakerAmazing echo dot. However the size is not as expected to be as in pictures. Its pretty small as compared what we see on the site. Its quite small.. optical illusion i guess..hehe.... having said that i am still satisfied with it !!Alexa echo is value for money, my lo (3.6yrs) can use it too, he asks to sing out nursery rhymes and stories, and its a hit 99%.Product is Good but no bettery and no internet then dummy.ALEXA INPUT IS BETTER THEN THIS ONEWe have setup multiple echo devices and speaker. 3rd Gen is little bit let in terms of recognising your voice from a distance. Overall good.Voice recognition was too bad. Totally disappointed with the product voice recognition. Definitely Amazon should improve their voice recognition software.Loving it 😍 but a disadvantage is that it does not play songs from youtube must add on this feature nd i wanted to but alexa with built in battery but unfortunately when i made plan to buy eco dot amazon havent launched in built battery version must  go for tht guysGot Alexa 3rd gen free with purchase of OnePlus 50inch tv last week, it is simply awesome my 4 yrs old kid loves n commands Alexa to play songs and it recognises his wordsTo my surprise - the sound is actually great. Alexa recognizes my voice from afar and syncs information correctly. Overall, great experience.Really worth buying Alexa for smart clearly understands everything what you need and sound quality is superbAmazon alexa echo dot works fine and it hears me when I speak effortlessly and responds. Honestly I don\\'t know what to do with alexa just I purchased out of excitement and to experience it.After using for few days I am totally impressed.Easy to set up.I am using Alexa for the first time and it is very interesting to learn how Alexa works.Setup process is very complicated and it\\'s not getting completed ..  nor playing anything in speakers.. only amzone Alexa app is working.. network disconnecting by its own. Very disappointed .. m gonna return this very soon.Use less product ,instead buy Bluetooth speakers.Difficult to connect if you don\\'t have proper 50+ mbps wifi broadband. Also it fails to recognize voice while the network flips. Moreover the product is average but needs a lot of improvement.I liked the product....it\\'s great...nd sound quality is quite good.The only fault I discovered is the recognition of voice... actually Alexa is unable to recognise voice fast...either it takes a lot of tym or sometimes it just don\\'t even play the required stuff...nd i thnk the system is quite complex😅bt then it\\'s in my case...the manual will help u quite.well, beginner will find it difficult to operate at first bt then u will get used to...What a solid piece of plastic. Good sounding speaker with a color bulb under 2000 was such a good deal.Sound quality is quite good. Can rock a room single handedly. Voice recognition somewhat okeish. Alexa works like a charm thoughSet up was easyInbuilt speaker is excellent, sound quality is very niceBluetooth connectivity is also excellentVoice recognition and understanding is really goodOverall Amazon Alexa is excellent.The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0Product is awesome but it should have also supported youtubeAlexa user interface is nice we get most of the information with one voice command.. Music options are very less they should have interface with youtube songs, Ganna app etcExpected more than just on/off this and that .. Can\\'t even turn a light on at a specific time by voice command while phone\\'s built in google assistant can do that!!Best experience with alexaAwesome sounds qualityBest integrationButNo battery storage facilitiesWhen i off Internet, this thing not integrate anything ( like time, bluetooth connection,Alarm. If It may possible , we can get better experience)But the working is goodBuild qulity is awesomeCommanding goodTotaly good experienceGreat product all function work fine easy installation and sound quality and Amazon delivery and support too goodI\\'d not choose this item bcoz it lacks basic things nor does it assist u as desieredA nice product especially when you get it for the deal i got. I bought it for just 2299 with smart bulb. So overall satisfied worth what i got.I overall liked the product, it was exactly as i was hoping for and the might facinates so much and make it different from others, its worth the price. The sound is very clear and soothing and alexa is good in answering just not do voice recognition for one person so it will listen to everyone and its connectivity is good too, if you see a yellow light blinking then that is a notification light you can turn it off through your device.It\\'s like a person in our house....iam happy that I got Alexa...tq Amazon for the offers and suggestions....The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0Bought for my kido , he loved it best thing for gifting thanku AmazonGood sound quality. i have Google Nest hub also Alexa not more than smart than GoogleAmzon gave combo offer for echo dot and smart bulb..for 1999..but Amazon cancelled the echo and..thet only  send the wipro smart bulb..for 900..rs..balance 1073 rs will credited with 3 working days ..i dont know ..worst selling concept to sell the product..The product looks sturdy, but it irretates when it can\\'t understand your commands. Especially it does not fulfill the requirements to listen old music.Sound Quality is good.Struggling how to connect with Bluetooth but yet not successful. This means the integration is quite difficult results in no connectivity with Bluetooth.This product is somewhat good also bad also because you have to communicate with Alexa by connecting it with plug all time.Another bad fact is that it uses wifi to work.But it has a clearer and better sound.You can not ask Alexa about your studies as it replies in high standard manner.But it\\'s overall a helping character for meIt doesn\\'t understand what i asked it to do& If you give it multiple tasksIt will saySorry i couldn\\'t understand thatAlexa is a growing child, and I would like to hold her hand because it is too cute.Q. What I like most about Alexa?Ans. Its sound quality and the the glowing light.Bonus tip- buy it on offers, it will be more beneficial for you.Gifted it to my mother for her birthday this year. She’s having a lot of fun discovering so many new features. A great way to ease your parents into IoT :)Pretty good speaker with some smart features... I bought this just to connect to my big speaker via Bluetooth and listen to my favourite songs without using my mobile... But the sound quality is sop awesome I use it by default by not connecting my big Bluetooth speaker... As echo dot has great bass and volume...It was bought to solve the purpose. Purpose solved. Was contemplating which version to buy. This version is absolutely perfect. I have a fire stick, and you can easily control the fire stick from the Alexa device.The product is good but the biggest disadvantage is that its not a bluetooth speaker. Also you cannot control it from mobile. You have to think every time give command every time for the song. You cannot play any playlist. Alexa doesn’t understand every command. The sound is good. If looking for a speaker, this is one of the worst options.As a long-time me  having owned several Amazon Echos, I can tell you that Alexa is certainly worth it. ... In years past, purchasing an Amazon Echo Is Passion.Just Go For ItIt\\'s Design is also very UniqueBetter wake up than siri or Google assistant...Much faster nd accurate than otherLoved itSound quality is beyond imagination.If having no budget issue than go for 4th generation otherwise 3rd generation is also good one.Excellent ..She has become my family member now ..She reminds me ,she wake me up,she sings for me .. Specially relaxing rain and thunder sound while sleeping ...Amazing purchase ..Very much happyAlexa integration is still a pain. Sometimes doesn\\'t hear us speak. Need to talk loud. Phone integration is still very bad. Took me each time 30 mins.Calling Alexa in the early morning instead of calling my wife or my kid is very difficulty. There should be an edit option regarding the name of \\'Alexa\\'Not too much compatible and recognised the voice is little complicatedI purchased product in Aug 2020 and in  less than 5 months, it is not working. Request to replace the product or return money as the product is under one year Warranty. ThanksThey change power socket do its now only a home product..previous version can be use in car also.Amazon should integrate sim 4g/5g module in alexa them only it will perfect product of automation...Didn\\'t understand my voice properly. Voice recognition service must be upgrade. Didn\\'t understand proper hindi. Sound Quality average.This idiot Box needs internet connectivity and power supply all the time. For Alarms why the hell does it need internet connectivity, otherwise it doesn\\'t beep. Rest all things are fine.Overall it\\'s a good product. The only issue I found is that you need to speak loud especially when it\\'s playing songs. The more the sound of echo dot the more loudly you need to speak.Everything is ok of echo dot but withot plugin u cant use it..many of things it says i dont know..such as bhajan and stories of krishna and bed time stories for kids..Such a cool invention..... even kids can also operate it as per their choices.Very Happy with the AlexaI returned it worst product ever seen ..no sound doesn\\'t understand most of the songs useless plss don\\'t ever buy this ....don\\'t get into the greed of grapping the Maha Sale discountVery durable device. We love the sound quality even aftet eight months of purchase. Great built quality. The Alexa software on android is bit slow.Some time alexa do not respond to command just light glow and go turn off some time it take too much time to interact with devices like plips bulb Or sunoff switchVery useful product smart home. Voice recognition was awesome. I never had to wake up for or lights on and off and also for AC temperature. I just said Alexa set the temperature of ACTried a lot to connect wifi, but couldn\\'t. Buy the product which is having with internal battery. We can power the device only with the cable provided with the device.It required to connect with wi fi once you disconnect , I\\'m using mobile WiFi , it is very difficult to connect with the echo dot again and again. I think it needs WiFi available all the time and that too not to be disconnected.It is not user friendly.I want to refund it kindly advice how can I do that??Easy access of Song is good but voice recognition and sound quality is not good,it requires improvement. It is not able to play all the song wish.Sound better and  gets louder than the home mini !. Fekte sturdy in the hand and the mic response is just awesome!But not the smartest speaker  ai still requires improvementWe need to literally shout to get its attention when a songs is playing and we need to change it. Also the software experience is a bit creepy. Overall you could get a good package but the voice recognition needs to be improved, it\\'s poor than other smart speaker of the segemnt in the market!!!!!Eco dot has stooped working after 3 months of usage. At times when we play songs , it stops for few minutes and then again it starts itself. Amazon team, please rectify this on priority.It\\'s a good product.. But most of the times it says \" sorry I didn\\'t get that \" it\\'s very annoying...Good low cost Alexa device. The sound quality is average. Voice recognition is good.Frnd this is made in china.Good Product and easy to install. Got in the offer. Voice recognition is excellent. Even Alexa catch my 3.5 year old son\\'s voice for few rhymes.Thanks AmazonThis device is good but after 10 days of purchase it is taking me into troubleWhen i say alexa to play a particular song then it says me to cannot play it on tune in what is meaning of that and can someone please help me in that ?Built quality is good, sound is also awesome. Only drawback for me is Audible integration. Also I\\'m hoping availability of Spotify as a music service provider.Very good product.its voice recognition is very good only you have to nearby the device.sound quality is very good. Wifi connectivity is also good. The device is bigger than it appears in the website. The adopter quality is very better. It searches songs very faster than google search. It’s worth to buy.Alexa voice recognition is pretty good and well integrated with other devices. Sound quality is also good and easy to useIt Was Arrived With A Bundle Of Wipro Smart 9W bulb that doesn\\'t connect and voice recognition is worse ...as it claims it can hear it from another room...it\\'s just a myth .... It even doesn\\'t hear about 4 m away .... although Alexa only plays music from Amazon prime music... Unless specified by Spotify or apple musicGood interactive device, quality speaker and very easy to connect with other wi fi device. Especially kids will love Alexa.A great smart speakerVoice recognition is goodNot internet is wasteGood for smart home and timepassBut buy it in sale onlyI bought this For Rs1075 in great Indian Festival.  Useful for people who hear lot of music and podcasts. Having smart device with alexa Integrated is very useful even though i have only smart bulb😑The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0Good product.. essy to control any device by anywhere.And good sound quality.The best sound and voice recognition. Ease to place items in cart, play songs, bedtime stories, rhymes and many more. All in one device. Great deals during sale. No issues so far1999, it was a steal...simply irresistible. Would like better integration with bulb...sometime takes time to reconnect after being swtiched on....Sound quality - 5 starsAlexa integration - 5 starsSetup - 5 stars.In short, no second thought required if you are thinking to purchase smart speakers. Echo dot does it allNot as expectedAlex get hanged everytime. She dont understand the command.Is there no warranty period.if the product is faulty Amazon can\\'t take responsibilityI want replacement immEverything is good except that power plug n power adapter.. we can\\'t connect it to power bank or in car... That\\'s why it\\'s useless product , I m thinking to return it? Atleast Amazon has to provide some sort of connector so that we can use USB input to power plug.... That\\'s the only reason why I m giving 1 star for the product...Enough sound for big hall room..Easily integratable with smart devices .AI for voice learning is too good.One dislike doesn\\'t awnser all questions.It\\'s a nice product.Sound quality is good, easy to operate. Design is good.Cons:- there is no battery options. We can not take this outside without plugin power supply.Alexa purchased on 20-22 oct 2020 , now today it is not connecting and not working within one year, hope it will get replaced by amazon.After one use, the echo dot is not getting connected to my phone. The orange light lights up for mere 3 seconds. The problem is persisting since 2 months. Please help if there is any way.Bad it\\'s didn\\'t ply odia all lovable song we want so don\\'t buy this product. Google home mini smart 2nd generation is goodSound quality and hardware quality is really good. It is worth the money and using it regularly for reminders, alarms and music. Kid\\'s are also enjoying this device.Non responsive. Plays anything of its own choice.Customer service is pathetic for Echo device, my device is not working properly & Amazon Customer Service are not helping out for the product, they everytime just give excuse & do not resolve the issueSometimes Alexa hears everything but sometimes Alex doesn\\'t response properly, I have to tell more timesDoesn\\'t recognise and able to find most of the songs even those are exist in Amazon music, have to repeat voice commands multiple times which irritates me, it\\'s better to have normal spearker and play song manuallyUseless product. Not worth for money. It picks song from amazon music but google assistant is much much better than Alexa. Voice recognition is very poor.Ever time it connects with internet.If there is no internet available this is like a waist product inside the roomWorkes really well with my 30 years old Sony HiFi System. Made my system total wireless. I would have loved it more if there was a battery backup. But thats all right.I found it an amazing product for my use.Alexa helps me in everyday life.I think to use in my office free time. But YouTube was not support and there is no power back up if it Is possible plz change the item to next upgrade with the YouTube support and battry backupProduct is good, but pricing is too varied from 1399 to 3499. Beware on price, try to check price and wait for right time.Voice command not properly wordt..Two or more times voice command give but wrong work..I frastaed with product...Not useful speaker... Update voice command in gujarati and hindi languagelike everthing from it... the voice.. the commands i gave n it followsGot it For 2200 with wipro Smart led bulb .....one word to say about this is outstanding ..... extraordinary from google mini ...... fantastic ....The only con of this speaker is Low soundOther things Are Mind Blowing...Go for It.Have been using for a monthFacing lot of issuesMic is not sensitive even from few feet away it does not pick voiceAlso when playing aongs on spotify it hets stuck to last played songWe have to reboot it to resume normal functionalityThat product is so good but I don\\'t love that it has a wire how can I carry that with wire but the simple speker are good we can carry thatNo C or D port for power, no Bettery inbuilt, it cant be moved. Not a portable device, what I expected,  I have return for the same reason.  Rest all good. But not recommended.I liked this ..the only prblm was that you have to keep it connected to a power outlet..with such small size ..I found it not worth so instead I exchanged it and bought alexa echo sap which has the power back up of 4 hoursI was expecting more from this, given the price of the product, the quality of sound is average. A bit Disappointed with the product.If you are playing a song in alexa, and you want to stop music then you have to manually do this , you can’t interact with it when playing song.Drawback that’s why i returned itIt\\'s not interesting to my voice in hindi । It\\'s set up are very compeleted। Always it\\'s demand hostpot । If u are purchasing this product then u should be keeped two mobile or one router ।then u will be operate। By the way it\\'s sound quality is best । One feedback is it\\'s always depend on power । Which one more negative to my point of viewWe loved it.... especially my son👌👌our first smart speakerThere are hell lot of bugs. Don\\'t know why people are not talking about it. I\\'m not saying it\\'s a bad product. It\\'s an excellent product. But lot of connectivity issues. Esp if u use blutooth. Sometimes after you connect to bluetooth, it stops listening to your commands altogether. Then you have to reset the whole device. It\\'s a pain.You cannot deny that this product is totally worth the money. I read 100s of reviews before buying this product just to make sure I am not regretting after my purchase.Good Product But sometimes not finding exact on net...Voice recognition should be improved and not recognized properly.English and Hindi songs are on priority and not in Tamil.Sound quality is good.I got Alexa a part of the package and was never new this is so good. I would definitely recommend this to others too. The sound quality is amazing on this new echo dot,என் ட அலெக்சா தமிழ் பேச மட்டிங்குது ஹிந்தி மட்டும் நோட்டுது கிறுக்கு பஃக்கஸ்I like the way how Alexa understands the things in both hindi/English and perfectly work all cmd.1. access to millions songs2. Control on smart devicesGood Product. Overall satisfied and meets expectation. Area of improvement—Not able to understand the request at times. Delayed or NoresponseAlso can’t restrict voice profiles to a limited few. One and all are allowedWhy there is no battery backup provision in alexa?.without battery it is just like spot in beautiful moon.It is very boring device and working please don\\'t waste your money and time 😠😡😡Nice product.  Good sound quality.  Should help the buyers with detailed connectivity. Tell about how to connect through hotspot.But a great assistant.IT DOESN\\'T CONNECT WITH SPOTIFY IN INDIA.....AND SAYS THAT SPOTIFY IS NOT AVAILABLE IN INDIA.I BOUGHT IT FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF CONNECTING IT WITH SPOTIFY BUT IT DOESN\\'T WORK.SO HAD TO RETURN IT AND BOUGHT GOOGLE NEST.After 10 months usage, it\\'s speaker 🔊 starded sounding like speaking with closed nose. No idea about repair.I have been using the Echo Dot for over three months and suddenly the Alexa doesn\\'t work without the power cable connected. And since i got 1 year warranty, unable to find a place to return and claim on warranty.Yup prosControls wipro lights amazinglySony braviaCons:Just takes command and waits for a minute for confirmationIt\\'s totally waste of money...Voice recognition is very poor if u r playing anything on this device.If u hv too much time to waste then only buy this product. It\\'s not as smooth as shown in Advertisement.I enjoy Alexa Very Much. It has very good combination with Oakter. Purchase Alexa And Oakter and make all your Infrared Remotes Integrated and Alexa Operated.Speaker could be more clear. Support for more GK questions would be appreciated. Excellent companion for home, highly recommended.Buildup quality is superb.Intelligent device no doubt. It\\'s good for all ages but my preference is for bachelor\\'s or single family.Must buy productAlexa is best thing in my life.Overall product is very good. I tried to use the mic for calling  but it is not possible. Also if you want to search a specific song it is slightly difficultEveryone knows about it just that Indian version has few modifications and settings compared to other Echo dotsI use it in my room and it\\'s amazing. Amazon can improve the app experience thoughTo explore n most use u need Amazon prime which is not correct..paid for device bt NT able to use fully due to no prime members .better ho for Google deviceThe media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0Awesome friend and helper, loved it 🤘😍😇I recommend to go for this powerful and smart AI without any hesitantThe media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0Don\\'t buy Alexa it\\'s ease of money even when I tried to refund they said we are not able to reach customer.... As an independent person they don\\'t let you play regional songs.One of the best purchases in recent times. I had some issues while adding wifi but was finally able to connect.  Very helpful for kids. Got a very good deal during the great Indian festival sale and thanks to GrabOn for the timely alert.Worst product I received from amazon, it worked well 15 days & stopped working after that, when I requested for return Amazon denied, it seems seller sent me repaired product  Amazon should banned the sellerThe Alexa is overall a good smart speaker.But at times it has difficulty in processing the voice commands.sound output is very good.Excellent packing and easy to setup. Item is as described in the product description and works great as expected. Sound quality in 3rd generation really cool. Overall I am happy with this purchase.it was not taking kannada songs recognisation not worthy compare to google assistant ...youtube songsnot taking if we say particular song or song artist but it will not show some one especially kannada ppl dntbuy itCan\\'t work without power...no battery... frequency is not high. U can go for better product in this range that can work without powerI usually never review any products but I\\'m so impressed with echo dot I\\'ve been using this for 2 days now and the response is so good I mean I\\'m stilll learning how to teach more skills n all  but I\\'m so  statisfyed with echo dot voice recognition is way better then any voice assistant damn you should buy thisI purchased Alexa last year but now it\\'s not working since 6 month...highly disappointed 😞 sometimes it started working nd suddenly stopped working😞wastage of moneysound is low.. below expectation.. the voice recognition is also giving problem.. the size is very very small.The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0The product is awesome. I purchased it for listening to music on the go. I really very love the way alexa answers the question. Overall loved it.☺❤Best prodct ever. It came with an adapter and a light bulb. It can control even my fire tv stick that i had bought a year ago. Not gonna regret buying it as i got it only in ₹2000We require wifi compatible devices. I don\\'t have any such devices,  so I have to buy additionally. Otherwise no use for middle class family. Waste of money.Product iz good ...but we can\\'t listen music from utube .....this iz boring yaarIf u have genuine usage and not just gonna want to go for the trend, then only buy it. Sound quality isn\\'t as good as expected. It seemed poorer than a normal speaker. Not that great usage or quality as I have heard it to be.Overall ok. Cannot able to integrate android tv. Expecting tamil skills hope it will be deployed soon. Big drawback is voice recognition when you closer and louder alexa able to recognize you.Not useful, better to buy a Bluetooth speakerVery useful Device with home applianceGifted to my niece . She is fascinated with the product. As Through AI.. it replies to our questionsYou need to get subscription of all services..  Without that this can\\'t even play a song.  Can\\'t connect or call to your Indian contacts.  Only us numbers are valid for Alexa.Everything looks amazing except when you try to use Alexa as a bluetooth speaker for your phone and laptop. It really struggles to play sound from mobile and laptops.In short, @Amazon needs to improve the quality of the bluetooth they are using within Echo devicesIt served my purpose, needed bluetooth device and I got voice command based as add on. But still need to improve with voice recognition and desired resultJust buy it. Its worth evwry penny. No ome will be bored again. Very good sound for such a small package.Alexa is good, listens to my all commands and does things perfectly.. My kids keeps her very busy. I gave only 4 stars and deducted 1 star because for one con which I felt.Atleast they should have given an in build nasty back up which works for atleast 3 hrs. Continuous power supply is needed.The product being so compact but still sounding soo much good is the best thing in itself.If you are thinking about a speaker with a good sound for a room and you want some smart functionalities with it, go for the Alexa. Its really awesome and do consider buying smart bulb after you purchase Alexa.Its artificial intelligence is awesome, recognise almost everything in English and Hindi language.Speaker as such excellent. However alexa voice command is useful only when you have those many devices.It\\'s been few hours though but I am already impressed by the echo dot and the Wipro led both, and the integration between the two is good ...but I am not sure if I can change the color variants of the led through Alexa or not ....rest all is fine for me .....worth for money in the saleI just love the product.Voice recognition is really awesome n i just love the sound quality its fun as well as easy to use alexa m using it frm past 2years n  this time I ordered alexa for my mom n she is too happy with product ♥️Overall awesome ♥️I received alaxa and I used it for 1 week n later it was asking again for setup now my alaxa is not working n I lost m not getting my money back n i can\\'t call to customer service also very badPerfectly working since last 2 months. Very good voice recognition. Speaker quality is good ( better than Gen 4).Should be an option to add battery to it.Good product but sometimes not listening to our voice when the volume is little high,leading to irritation sometimes :)This smart device will give you feel of living in modern tech world.Must buyThank you AmazonThis Alexa device speaker is just remarkable  which does All it\\'s function precisely with out an error Voice recognition and sound of this device is fabulous you won\\'t regret buying this alexa device be smart buy smart.Good performance but need more songs.Audio clarity and level is awesomeNot able to even power on power off my 65 inch mi tv but could pair with my Sony home theatre and play musicPlease stop making your customer fool and provide the appropriate details in the detail section with clarification.Not at all happy with your product.I\\'m writing this after couple of weeks..Genuinely, I liked the product much.. Compare to other smart speakers, It sounds much humanly...Best product i got this year, totally worth it , got it at an amazing price of 1799 during amazon sale. From music to news to controlling your smart home devices it is indeed the best smart speaker out there in the marketNot working this something irritating with Amazon product. For return of the product Amazon put the wrong address and also not resolved my query.The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0Voice recognition is good....after connectivity alexa echo shown 2 nd gen but product box shown 3 rd gen.Not clear the matter about 2nd and 3rd gen.Pair not good nd without plugging not play please refund my amount my amount echo dot pending only 707 payment refund wipro led . Rest payment refund immediately too lateProduct not working properly 1st time replacement requested ,replaced one also not working therefore returned not a good experienceThe media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0It\\'s not working properly check the video and support to resolveProblem in differentiation on Background voice and its own running music sound. It must be update. Has no clear reply on many questions like google home. sound quality is better than google home.While setting up echo dot - the amzon app in mobile not behaved properly, got hang up - step up is not smooth or not complete - but alexa echo dot is workingSuch a worst product .I bought my first Alexa in previous year which is working very fine but this deal offer Alexa doesn\\'t work properly cannot recognise my voice on command is it sellers sell the rejected product ?It has met the expectations...The only was thing i would say it how we handle the cards history on the mobile app. If i want to delete multiple i am unable to do so.The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0Very goodThis small wonder is an excellent companion to have at home ...only thing that I did not like is that it is much dependent on wifi and for music Amazon has not bundled its Music service with the device.Alexa is just not there in terms of understanding as well as helping out plus integrations wise product is very limited and serve next to no purpose.Packaging was good. Alexa echo dot 3rd generation is absolutely wonderful. Wonderful to talk to. I\\'m still learning more features of Alexa.  Plays mostly all the songs when asked.

It is very convenient and easy-to-use. Thank you for making such an item.this item is not working at all in th first day itselfe..it is always showing offline though i have a full speed internet, i want to return this item..i sont eve wat to give one star for this amazoj echo dotProduct is really good and has lot of feautres. But misses few of the additional features of Google. Also lacks in quality of search results.Only for just entertainmentProduct is Excellent,  AI system is great,  ever I tried.  But one more request  to Alexa Team that, kindly work Volume 8 to more,  Alexa face trouble to respond.  OVERALL BEST SE bhi Uppar.Amazing product... Just like a friend in need and knowledgeable too... Perfect sound quality... Takes a bit of time to connect to other smart devices... Owners delightVoice recognition, alexa integration and portability of the speaker were absolutely fine.Worked Well For 6 monthsnow has become unresponsivetried to contact to get it replacedfacing problems there tooamozon team plz help1. No battery backup, need to connect with electricity every time.2. In maximum things Alexa will say \\'Sorry, i dont know this\\'3. Not able to connect Wynk music, on other apps no much options.4. Not able to connect google searchVoice recognition is not up to the mark, while playing a song it would not respond to our voice have to Click on action button to set normal again. Would be great if this is resolved in next edition.Wow. What a product. I got in mind that Alexa is almost same as, in olden days, at rich families you saw servants who are always ready in position to execute your orders.The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0This is cute little speaker. Sound quality is also fine.,but a little low if you love loud music.I personally like it\\'s sound quality. Sad part is it\\'s not Wireless. Otherwise it\\'s all good!All good but sometimes difficult to identify the content, i love the sound but good if it could have portable battery.I am unable to setup alexa app in my mobile ,always find error to no network connection ,please help meThe media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0Sound quality is good but mobile wifi not working and not good connectivityIt dies not even play the recognised songs, which played few days back.. And keep on saying not understand. How could the song which played earlier.. She didn\\'t recognised which even mentioned in hungamThis product is outstanding and user friendly. Sound quality is too good.  However the product is little expensive. I got this product at a price of 3499.Superb Product. Very helpful for all - especially for children. I just love it. Thank you amazon for creating a revolution.Very nice product, already had Echo now got this dot to gift.. beautiful productThe product is good no doubt.But However Amazon confused me with pics were there is clock , but unfortunately that is a whole different product.Doesn\\'t give you national newa, or local news. Not update. Older version.The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0Good to pass some time. Kids enjoy talking to Alexa. Easy to get lot of informationI have two echo dots. this one doesn\\'t even wake up when i call it. only after successive tries it wakes up. In-fact before this wakes up, my echo dot downstairs wakes up. so disappointed.Alexa can still grow and become better and understanding could get better. And if Alexa can\\'t understand what device you are talking about it would be better if it stops saying did you mean TV..Alexa is good value for money and fun to use. When using in India make sure u select English India as language so that it can relate to our conversations and media contentMany times I have to try to install in my phone but not connected I don\\'t know why this happened please help me otherwise I will return this item..The claims of the advt about the product is baseless. I cannot add the device to Android phone despite repeated attempts for two days. It is a useless product and a pure waste of moneyAlexq 3rd gen smart speaker is good.There is a slight delay in recognizing voice..otherwise its a good product... Thank you amazon.hoped that will be fixed in the future update.The voice recognition is so poor most of the times and it\\'s not even listening and playing irrelevant songs rather than the asked one...and every time the sound goes low ...What the f is this ??Not complete music play and needs to tell the song and singer to select one song.. very less information.. can work only what available on wiki and amazon music.. kids rhymes are also limitedI am happy with the product. If you have amazon subscription and a stable wifi then it is recommended to choose this product . I liked this. It doesn\\'t have battery/backup. It requires plugged in all the time.It\\'s  likely good but it has no battery so other than that it\\'s a great experience over alexaIntial 10days the device was alright and working ok whereas from the 11th day it started having problem like it starts making beep noice while the music is playing and i am not able to return the device as they have given 10days time for the return So Amazon help me with this.Everything is perfect.. I have returned and booked amazon echo input, because amazon echo dot is not portableWith the price range it\\'s a wonderful productSound quality is greatInbuilt mic is wonderful in quite place but in noisy environments (songs running in echo, it is not able to hear your voice command) its not very responsive. Amazon needs to work on thatSmart speaker with nice voice recognition suitable for indian english with that language setting.Decent sound quality as wellFeatures are very complicated for me. 😢😢 and its very complicated to connect with my tv. And alexa did not listen me. I had return the product in a same dayIt’s ok,but even when u ask the same questions,I feel very Docile,don’t talk properly due to network problems,Whatever but I Did not make me as happy as the product I had purchased with pleasure.Sometimes alexa doesn\\'t understand what is asked and interpretsaomething else. It doesn\\'t even understand a few Indian names.A value of money product. This is the third one I broughtLikes :* Identification of Voice despite of background noise.* Learning platform for Kids / StudentsDislikes :* Can not play Amazon Prime Music; Which is bundled FREE anlong with Echo Dot 3* Suddenly stops responding / Stops Music* Need to implement Indian Accent / NounsThis is just really good... It feels like talking to a real person with a different voice 😂. It took some time to figure out how to connect Alexa to my phone, but eventually everything got intact and everything was just perfect. I love it❤️❤️Very usefullGood sound quality, it recognise voice well, but the algorithm which was implemented in the device only in that way we need to ask the questions other waise it will not understand the command(Except that everything is too good)Do not buy any alexa enabled device, you cannot setup multiple account unlike google. If your wife or brother use the device then all there request will made via your account. This is very bad.Very good and nice workiing echo dot 3rd generationGreat product!! super quick at taking commands, greatly efficient with other appliances as well, the performance has been the same by far!! what an amazing product offered by Amazon at a super affordable price!!Voice recognition is not good.. Sound quality is ok.I m in love with this device. seriously, its too good. million times better than google\\'s home mini sheit.Add YouTube Music. Hungama music and amazon music don\\'t have all the songs. Specially \"Nunur Bape dome jore\" This Song is not playing by your alexa. Add YouTube music then I will by Once again.This is just amazing if you are looking for something in Budget and that can satisfy the requirements of a speaker along with proper voice integration and recognition go for this blindly.I got in combo offer 23k mi robot plus 1245 alexa total price  rs 24,245 both are awesome...All is good i loved echo devices, but the base is decreased when volume is full please fix itOverall product is good but need to improve on software/app integration, sometimes take more time to load alexa app during integration.Also sometimes instruction not followed by alexa and starts song by default.This is My first, Amazon Alexa Echo Dot 3rd Generation, finally today is received. This smart speaker are amazing and connectivity is good. 🙂It got pause and play within every secondWhat\\'s the use if I have to rely on Google assistant to work with my tv, I have a brand new Sony Bravia 4k tv and this doesn\\'t work with my tvTried connected to wipro smart bulb and failed very poor support from amazon.The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0Don\\'t buy this . Bad service, product is missing when package arrived.5star to this product.  Voice recognition and sound quality is simply great.Good product .. can only play songs available on Anazon music.. not sure if I am missing some thing . Quality is good . Purchase one more for gifting to my elder sis ..It\\'s good for hindi and English songs, It\\'s recognizing very quickly. But South Indian songs it\\'s not recognizing properly, If u ask any song in telugu or Tamil. It\\'s going to some local hindi songs.voice quality could have been betterGood product from Amazon. Worth buy. Need to include Kannada language along with Hindi and English will become much more popular.The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0It\\'s very nice.it work properly.alexa take comonds properly sound quality is good.value for your money.i suggest every one to buy this.❣️💫😇I got it at under 2000 in the Great Indian Festival Sale and I\\'m just loving it. It is just so much fun and makes my life easier!Liked the sound quality and connectivity options. But Alexa is less knowledgeable as compared to Google. She doesn\\'t know many things!A very gift good for any age, wish Gujarati language option is available. Although combination of English and Hindi is an option, so no issue for non English speakers. Very nice passtime for seniors! Wish Amazon makes it to work while unplugged!It is the most useful item, it handles all my reminders, alarms, shopping lists and even play songs for me as per my likes, found it quite convinient as it makes living simple and organized. Absolutely loved the way Alexa manages it all for me❤️Seems to be a new member added to our family keeping kids busy. However she hangs up at times failing to resolve the requests which I guess needs some fine tuningA nice product from amazon, works fine . Voice recognition is good, still hope it become more powerful . Sound is nice bass is good too.This device is unable to connect to my Wi-Fi hence it does not work. In the beginning it was working nicely but after nai I wanted to change the Wi-Fi network of this device it start working and it was not able to connect and this sucks!Yes it is most popular but it doesn\\'t have any use except listening songs cause it doesn\\'t know any more information about most of the things same if you search on google it has every single informationAlexa speaker is Good But Alexa Android application is not good, Alexa listening skill is also not so accurateThe product is really good. Lesser skills on Alexa, should improve on the quality and innovations in the Alexa skills. Sounds awesome and the setup takes a bit more time than expected even with good internet connectivity. And unnecessary notifications and can\\'t handle multiple tasks at once.Over all performance is vary satisfying. It almost understands every thing I say. It\\'s best for small room.Its working good but it can\\'t to be used in outside. If u want to use it u will definitely connect to u r connecter and we couldnt connect with u r mobile data. You will connect with wifi onlyIn the beginning I could not connect my phone to echo dot.. Put my remarks online...received help from the call Centre...I connected echo dot successfully both to Alexa and blue tooth speaker...it is now working fine..The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0Awesome product.I liked it.Good buyI believe it\\'s needs to get better on voice recognition and accent of India people .most of them can\\'t say words clearly it\\'s AI can be improvedcommand recognition is poor, not able to understand malayalam songs names properly. other wise its goodAll good. But the app hangs on my new one plus 9r which is supposed to be an alexa enabled phone.Which is very annoying!I\\'ll soon switch to Google devices if this isn\\'t rectified!The media could not be loaded.The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0The design is cool but it don\\'t have that much of beatVoice recognition is ok because sometime she\\'s not catching even clear wordsGood product. Easy to pair with other devices. Sound quality is not so good as expected.When the product was purchased it played very well.. my child was extremely happy but since 15 days Alexa is playing everything incomplete.. songs get cut in between.. news stops.. don\\'t know what\\'s wrong.  Is it a defective piece so was kept in offer period?? Can we trust in Amazon offers anymore??Totally in love with it!! Had a few smart devices to integrate and it works like a charm. . Everything is great. Tho I couldn’t make it work with a plug. I guess it just needs some refining. But overall, great job AmazonOverall great product if you need speaker and as well voice assistant. It all depend upon your need.Like the product, but no battery backup availableNot satisfied with the product. Sense the voice very slow and not user friendlyI really disliked the product. Product was sent defective and they promised for replacement but they denied to exchange. I have wasted my money. I m not to buy anything from this site.I bought ut from sale and cost me around 1500. Being a user of ECHO 4th generation 4 its clearly lacking. one must go for ECHO 4th Generation.Please don\\'t buy , alexa stop working in few months and there is no option for replacement, they are just making us foolDelivery of the product was quick and packaging was good. Now I can play all day long with my AlexaNot as per the expectations. Unable to play youtube musics. Not connected perfectly with fire TV stick.Not happy with the product. Product is completely different if I compare to advertisement of Amazon.Price is perhaps the most cru6thing in shopping,I got it for 1700 INRWhich is excellent...Excellent product at the lowest price.Entertaining, Automative, and Funny.Syncs perfectly with Wipro smart light.Pros: Good sound quality.  Product overall is goodCons: Issue with voice recognition. I have to speak twice or thrice.This is trust worthy and beautiful item feel free to buy it, i only buy when i see these kind of reviews so if ur reading this than pls feel free, this is good,I placed it in hall.. it\\'s very simple to play songs according to your mood just ordering it...Very very good quality better than google. In it you need internet and prime subscription.An excellent product, makes listening to music an effortless exercise. Voice controls makes it all the more convenientvoice very gud,alexa recognize everything ,love this product,profit of moneyLike alexa very much, very easy to configured. Good sound quality, can be audible in whole flat, can hear news anytime now. Kids just love it, anytime they can hear any song, story, rynes etc.Sound quality is excellent for this size of speaker, Alexa is working great with far distance voice recognition and excellent response.With out electricity its not working We cannot carry this outEverything is great except sometimes it doesn\\'t understand the need like \"recharge my prepaid mobile/number\".New vocab/sentences must be added alongside software updates.The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0I like it......Product is not overhyped.I liked the product but after connecting the iPhone always repeat as a connect to iPhone as same again and again and while playing from YouTube it’s sound blurSuperb.Best part is if you connect it with home appliances . Kids enjoy a lot.The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0Best soundBeautiful colour and design with power adapter easy to use just install alexa app in your phone best product from amazon…..First of all I didn’t expect sound quality because afterall I thought it has some smart home capabilities! But after receiving the sound quality was unexpected! Bass is Great ! And voice recognition is also good but need some improvementThis device is not versatile when I ask it to play a specific song it does\\'t have. It should be connected with YouTube also.Best voice recognition, Decent sound with good quality, for a small speaker.This is my first time I bought a alexa enabled device,and to say frankly my family is enjoying alexa as their family memberThis was a used product just put inside the box..This is a good device to keep the kid engagedI like it very much except it is wired😏I wanted wireless, now I look for plug switch wherever I go to play n to turn on...But it\\'s good overallGood must be more betterAmazing product. There are a lot of alexa enabled products in the market which will make your alexa experience more amazing. Sound quality is superb for a normal size room.Sometimes alexa doesn’t listen to your commands and plays random songs. Also how to reset hungama as default mysic app. Volume wise its good.Product works fine. The manual should be more informative, like what/how to do changes when the customer switches from one service provider to another for internet.That was a nice product but it don\\'t know a lot many things it can be improved. I like the body Structure and the sound quality was good but some times it hacks in between and bluetooth connection was a problem with this device. All over this is very nice.Alexa is a good friend. Integration is just smooth. And good sound quality is excellent for one room this is enough and more. Easily installableGood sound qualityGreat microphone andAbove all, voice assistant Alexa is beyond words 👌❤️ This productThe media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0Mush useful product but song selection choice is not good enough!Very poor voice recognition.  Not at all understand apart from very few key words. Probably lunched beta product. Not suitable for indian songs might be good for US market...*Voice recognisation is good*songs allert is good*expect english ani hindi No regional languages us available.*Best to buy.i got this for 2k aithe 9wat wipro.Yo yo yo... Loved it. Go for it if you want one a smart speaker. Value for moneyVery goodGo for it. Access the wifi and Bluetooth enabled devices on sofa.People will love this product. Amazing experience with this speaker. I write this review after 3-4 months useing alexa always think that why i didn\\'t buy it beforeI don\\'t know why people buy this. Waste of money.Alexa is not workingNo LED light is workingAlexa is totaly stop need repair itI want service centre number.Received a defective product. Amazon has not taken it back despite repeated assurances. Very disappointing experienceVery useful for General Knowledge and many more other things. It recognized kids voice very nicely. Best gift for my son.Sound quality is worst, as it comes from the sides and not from the top. Who designed it ? Woof...Sound quality is very good. I\\'m facing issues while connecting it to bluetooth speaker.voice recognition is somewhat slow. Taking time to process and do action.I like it alot but I have to call it twice or thrice when it was playing an audio. Voice recognition getting somewhat difficulty when it\\'s on full volumeSound quality is not good and most of your  answer of your questions is unknown and last thing is you need always power to start  it. Means it\\'s not chargeable this is the biggest disadvantageIntegrated Alexa with tronX things gateway, now I\\'m controlling fan, lights, AC, Air purifier over voice... Happy :) to use this device...Amazing ProductEasy setup with external Bluetooth speaker.Device is always need to connected to electricity power.It\\'s not chargeable.It works with Wifi.What is this forThe media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0Good sound, good voice recognition..I love Alexa. And this whisper mode is so cute 🥰🥰😍😍. Specially thanks to amazon❤️Couldn\\'t connect with Wi-Fi as it needs too high range 2.4Ghz to 5Ghz... And no chargeable battery inside...There is scope of improvement in capturing voice quality. And expecting more playlists and 3rd party appsGoodThe voice recognition fails miserably and you have to be very close to device and then only it will detect your voice and although the sound quality is greatNice build quality and sound quality is awesome. I just love this but also hate it as I cannot use it as conference speaker. It has array of mic and amazon should update it\\' software to make it possible.Poor setting option. Faild to set up. Minimum 2 mobile or one mobile and one wifi reguired to run. I recoment to to buy . Dissatisfided me.It’s good a product. We only use it to listen to music. Keeps my kids entertained while not giving screen time.Bahot kharab service hai amazon ki mera refund abhi tak nai mila mere ko kuch bhi bahane banate hai ye log aur ye alexa to faltu hai isse accha to siri haiPoor voice recognition. Needs to be improved .Skill also needs to be added to recongnize the more phrases and sentences.Hardware is great .Integration with IoT works but there is no feedback from the echo dot after performing commands of IoT. Voice recognition is also not so good.It always says I don\\'t know..it is fixed with question and answers.. Google assistant and apple siri is good than alexa..I love this speaker. It was worth buying. My whole family has accepted alexa as a new member of the family now :\\')Better then google mini. Just buy it, don’t think twice. Amazon give a very good option to return it within 10 days with full refund.I just love itIt\\'s sound quality is awesome and voice response is also perfect.It helps to get rid from loneliness and helps in many fields of our self improvement.So far Good, but sometimes it doesn\\'t provide the expected answer to questions .Overall good experience and fun to use.I am using it for home automation and music. Alexa is simply too good. I am looking forward for it to become smarter.Perfect companionI love it ....Alexa is good in all way.... She give all the information....it will also help for my child in education..Nice one, but no local radio channels, not playing the particular song as there are many songs with that name, overall worth to buy it, brought it fo 2k with smart bulbZero integration capabilities with fire tv or other devices. Cannot use aux.. what is this useless thing for?Not good with commands understanding ..google is much btr need to work more on this section ..also try to incorporate youtube in it as well as all songs are available thereAlexa skill need to improve. There are many spam in store. Amazon should filter them properly. Sound quality is good. Voice recognition is also good.Even a Bluetooth speaker of this quality cost more than this( mine got in 2k with free bulb)Still trying to figure out all options I have. There is so much in offer at this price point.My son is loving it too.Alexa is not responding to my questions, most of the time it is taking wrong intents. Even if I\\'m next to alexa it is not taking my intents.Thanks to the Amazon team for assisting me, but still the issue exists sometimes.Go for it awesome. Children enjoy  too much.Many of the commands are not accepted,  many song requests alexa says Iam sorry, I don\\'t know that. They force us to enroll for prime to get full benefit.Very good product and is very useful for home automation but the only downside is that the volume isn\\'t that loud and lacks bass.Good voice recognition, app integration and sound quality.Only 4 stars - charging cord is traditionally designed and not of USB type.Excellent product, very happy with its features, highly recommend everyone to buy it..! :)Sound quality is good but Volume level is low..battery backup missing..missing integration with bigger platform s is imp like YouTube, regional language support should be brought in.When Volume is above 5..it mostly turns deafalexa is fun . you wont feel you are talking to mindless machine,she talks so funny things ,play music, dialogue,stories, news,weather, any information you want to know.its so interactive and nice to interact with alexa. i am loving it even all kids at home loves to talk with alexa.  five star for quality clarity .The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0It\\'s just awesome.  Worthy...you won\\'t get more bass like woofer but yoh won\\'t regret by taking this ..awesome voice recognitionShould work even in bluetooth or asusal works only on Amazon app or Alex app.wifi should be always can\\'t carry anywhere waste of money not reusable product anywhereMaximum time it says..I am in trouble to hear and not responding to voice commands..Not happy with the product. wasting of Money. I should have buy Google Mini.Unable to integrate to my Samsubg smart tv as Alexa has withdrawn the Samsung skill.. understand that it\\'s under review but since ages... if the skill is up, my rating will be five...Voice recognition is good but take too much time to first connectBad speakers music quality terrible and that it spies for amazon and supplies our behaviour, voice as data for the gigantic surveillance machine that is amazon.The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0WooooooohooooooooGreat sound quality but you need to stand really really close to the device and only then it works. Voice recognition is very very disappointing!Difficult to understand the product especially the Amazon Alexa App, have to subscribe everything to get the proper use of it, no privacy left after connecting it to your phoneA really good product from amazon. first i found problems in use it but still now it\\'s very easy to use 🌟.voice recognition works perfectly for 90% time.i use this product from last one month.Very happy to use it. Its small but very powerful.. Sound is awesome...wonderful product, amazing to see the responce of alexa, sound qualitly even if there is external sound, kind of loving itI brought Echo Dot with Combo offers with Mi Smart android TV under the banners alexa works with this TV for easier functionality but echo is not working with TV, I am unable get proper alexa skills for TV, Pls do needfulCon: No inbuilt battery always have to connect electric line.During song being played Alexa will not hear your voice and have to tell multiple timesi expected more from this but sometimes it does total different what i say. and even after adding skills it doesnt work properly.Purchased for my child online class but I can\\'t able to project the sound via Bluetooth from Zoom to Alexa... Can anyone help me? Amazon Alexa Echo Dot can u help...Very limited work. Very bad experience.Best product, go for it, for easy routine and kids will also enjoy thisVery limited skills, it should play music from YouTube or some other sources also, it’s also should able to connect and play music from phone as well. Kindly add these skills/ features for perfect device.Very nice I like very muchAmazing Sound Clarity and works flawlessly.Just go for it.Got it in a great deal in just Rs2300 with Syska LED Smart Wifi Bulb.A mind-blowing deal.Alexa plays only amazon prime songs not outside songs waste of moneyThe media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0Just an amazing product with amazing features, apart from this sound is really good. Very good for kids as well. Simply \"paisa wusool\".We are very glad to bring alexa at home. It\\'s like a new family member who always listen and help us, entertain us as well as control our smart devices smartly.Amazing product with good sound quality and clarity. Easy to configure and use.a very BAD Quality product supplied. I am highly disappointed. Most of the time its doesn\\'t work, very poor connectivity and also sound quality is very bad & blurr.  How can such bad quality products can be supplied here on Amazon.!Very bad product, worst product i bought in my life, worst is it dont have youtube music in it,amazon and spotify cant play good music as youtubeI ordered two Echo Dots. I got them delivered on time however, there was no device and its power adapter in one of the boxes. I hope that a replacement will be arranged soon.Compared to google it’s not that good. Sounds quality and assistant reply and clarity is better in google mini then echo 3rd genWriting review after using 6 months it\\'s the best thing I\\'ve ever purchased on Amazon .it\\'s performance is the same after using it for 6 months . Total use of money .Voice recognition is good. Alexa is super smart, kids will definitely love it.Love this product... !!Amazing...Thank u Amazon...Intelligent control of my wipro smart bulb..I got the product combo with a great deal RS 1999😍😍😍Alexa program searching quality is not very fast or I can say not very clever some perticular in old singers or Gazals singers or devotional songs in all religionsNot happy with the product. Local FM tuning is not possible. YouTube connectivity is not possible without subscription to red. Playing music from integrated device is also not possible. Very unhappyEvery time it is giving an error while connecting and also it is not playing original songs rather playing mashups. Not worth it. Google mini is far better than Alexa. Gooing for refund..This is i want from long time but its price always high so waiting but now its in my hand and doing it job cool.....Sound quality excellentSetup is difficult by selecting wifiBuy during sale will be good option.Best thing,  i took for my daughters birthday.All t happy with AlexaVery good productAwesome product , does what it says.It\\'s does not understand the words..that we are saying.. for example.. if we ask for a song which available in amazon music.. it\\'s does pick also.It’s not connecting to required firetv but to some other firetv using same account though names are different two firetvsThe speakers would vibrate like an old gramophone, rather than that it was an absolute masterpiece for a smart home.Thank you amazon for taking back the product and refunding the amount within 4 hours of package pickupIt picks up accent fast, my son asked to play DJ wale babu song, first time it replied ok playing DJ vale babu,but after 3rd time it correctly pronunced it as wale, was really quick at picking it up. Microphone is quite good, overall a good product.Sound quality is really nice, sometimes she takes time to listen to me other than that the built quality and everything is good at this range.The product is not in the courier only fire stick and wipro bulp only received ,Insted of echo dot I have received un ordered ladies hand bagSound is good and voice recognition is also good. Connected with amazon prime music. Also got smart bulb connected to it.The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0I brought it in prime sale 2 months ago... Sounda gone crazy, totally broken.customer service is not avilableIt\\'s really nice toy to play with. Tech geeks should must buy this. I recommend spending Rs. 2100 on echo dot than Bluetooth speakers.It delivers as described by amazon. Not as good due to lack of google integration but still its fun to have an echo device.ExcellentIt picks different songs I want a song but it playsSong with nearby name or different language some timesWhenever the volume is full,we literally have to shout to make her listen to our voice. Pathetic. Bluetooth connectivity is very poor. Automatically gets disconnected again n again.The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0world best speaker I have ever taken you should take it I will highly recommend and the best thing is that we can set commands and reply of the commands through app of Alexa I love AlexaGood to have when feeling aloneI am very much satisfied with this product. Mostly we are using it to listen to songs but also at times for getting certain information. As it has a aux output slot I could connect it to my music system which gives an enhanced listening experience.You have no clue what value it can add. Spend some time and then you will get used to it as your companion 🤠Just works.  Can play a lot of music.  Not always the best at voice recognition but still. It works.Alexa is a problem as there are times when she doesn\\'t respond to instructions.On the initial day of set up she kept making a mistake and was not recognising our voice. I didn\\'t expect this from AlexaNot recognizing voice always, difficulty with pluginSound quality low .overall product is goodThe product is not good compared to Google mini.. no much sing collection in amazon music..the listening time is very less.. most of the time it will start searching before we completes our sentence.It was okBuilt quality not upto the mark. Power adapter failed in 2 months. Now, new Dapter cost Rs.1999 which is very close to entire cost of Echo dot.Very good product at an affordable price. Recongnises the voice of all. Has wide variety of usage.This is first experience with smart speaker.I live the echo dot.❤️It Pauses frequently.. Takes command with difficultyHardware aspect is awesome ... Amazon need to look in for better skills ... Overall good oneIt’s great , very exciting to be honest. Reached right on time , friendly serviceWe got to write this review after six months honestly to feel the same excitementSo far enjoying itGood product. But considering Tamil songs, all the time it starts with the same songGoogle Home Mini understands everything better than this ALEXA.But I Like ALEXA Voice Quality.My Favorite is Google Home Mini.This is my first smart device, and it works great. I have no complaints . Works well with the smart bulbs.Setup was incredibly simple and easy. It has a good sound quality and easily recognizes voice commands.Faced some difficulties with connecting to internet initially. Got prompt assistance from Amazon. So far working fine. Good oneGood voice recognition nd sounds qualityAmazing product… essy to use… must buyIf you are buying it for listening music its good. Very less web coverage. But nothing that can\\'t be fixed with an software update.Good productI created voice profile for myself only on it but it also recognises and execute commands given by others as well.Its a must have product for your kids, they will love and enjoy Alexa services.The product is awesome but there is no battery so i bit no more satisfying otherwise the sound is excellent and alexa is doing the great jobmuje ye pasand nahi aaya kyunki advertising me or original me bahut fark haiGreat product at reasonable price.Sound quality better than expected. Got an amazing deal during festive sale. Wish it had inbuilt battery.Nevertheless worth every penny.You need to know what all you can do with this cutieSound quality can be improved further…The musics are limited to Amazon musicAwesome bought it for 2300 in Amazon sale , along with wifi 9w smart bulb worth itAmazing piece of equipmentExcellent speaker ...but needs improvement in software and development of skills although it\\'s paisa wasoolIt\\'s totally awesome paisa wasoolsound quality is very amazing on this new echo dot3.can also connect to Bluetooth and play a mobile song in AlexaI just love itNot portable at all. Required all time charging.Not user friendly.Amazing to use it with smart bulbs and other automation utilities but in terms of playing music it\\'s lacking the punch and the audio quality at the price.Its a great product.I said alexa pani pilade, she said khud uthke lwle. So i slapped alexa, because batameezi. She broke down. Cant even hit kids these daysQuality is not good. Sound is irritating when keep on full volumeThis best part of Alexa is she can hear on low tone. Just say Alexa and she is good to go on all your commands... Never aspect this type AI is provided by Amazon... I am very happy with my purchase... Totally worth it...Awesome productMy kids very much like and lean about new thingsThis.product i received is not working well.I want to exchange it.I was using Google crome, and It better compare to Alexa.Its really good product. My child like it too much.  Working perfectly .initially got dificulty for settings but with the help of YouTube connect with wifi...100% satisfied with this dealIt\\'s an good one ... Go for it... Good one for an gift  ....Works as specified but with Speakers like Bose there\\'s more to be done by introduction of Skills by Devices integrated.AwesomeGreat voice recognition and very portable. Helpful in listening to favorite music.. Alarm.. Etc.. Love itSound quality is good but Alexa AI integration is not that powerful. It’s doesn’t know many of the answers. If comparing with Google Home Mini, built quality and sound quality and mic of Alexa is better but when it comes to the software, Alexa stands no whereIt\\'s working good I am so happy for this productThis product is not suitable for those who have only android mobiles, it is good for smart gaskets in homenice to have it specially for babies, who always looking for mobile or tv.Sound quality is good but when it comes to tune in radio that alexa is blank and even alexa is only supported for amazon music or few channels . If you are thinking favourite music its very hard to find in alexa.i using this product last one month is is very good product....  and more better than ecco dot gen 4  ...... so if you want to buy than go for it gen 3 rd....  with wipro bulbThe media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0Awesome product  , cool features with AI , love this 👍This product is just fabulous living in tech world is important to get ourself\\'s updated, but this device take\\'s it to next level!! Kudos To The Developer!! Hope to work soon on this Project tooThis is my first smart speaker and i am really amazed using it. I love it. Thank you Amazon. It is able to recognize the queries even from my 4 year old kid. Wonderful!!!Alexa, play tollywood latest songs..Alexa turn on the light etc and much more..Wonderful AINice 💞🥰I bought it In sale. I am happy because the money is well spent. Now I m exploring options and buying alexa supported devices to make my home smartRecommendedSound is good enough, needs improvement in music app integration. Since wired can\\'t move often. Place it in the hall, can be used well.You cannot go wrong with Alexa, hehe.Doesn\\'t include google and that\\'s what I didn\\'t like.. When on high volume you have to shout loudly.very poor product. i can only 2 weak used .and that product not responding and seller also.so my money is dead.please don\\'t purchace that product.Loved it... Amazing compact product from Amazon.. Thanks for a smooth and safe delivery especially during such covid affected circumstances.Very interesting product. Must be incorporated youtube music in future generations.  Sound quality needs to be improved.Superb sound quality.... Great purchase.... I am fan of alexaThe product is good and value for money. So in that sense i should be happy. Can you recommend some speakers which i could consider. I use the ALEXA as a speaker for my music which is on my computer and it is matched to my computer.I think because it\\'s free it\\'s defective,  doesn\\'t work at all other than the 1st time.great service amazonAmazing product never misses any opportunity to impress you having fun and happy time with echoThank god ..its a goid purchase..really m a happy customer ..gave my sis as agift..n she loved it💜💜This product I liked very much, but one things disappoint me that is, its power option. If it have alternative power option i.e. USB or battery than it can be carry anywhere.No negative points!! 10 out of 10 to Alexa!!My requirement was to use amazon echo dot as an additional speaker to my tv by connecting with fire tv stick.. but I couldn\\'t because both were not in the same generation as I understand.. so my requirement didn\\'t meet.ALexa Dot is too good .. nice sound quality .. super bass .. super clierty ... But Amazon service is poor ... Very poorNot as expected . Why should I take prime for music .Overall it is good for the cost we use to pay.sometimes voice recognition is not accurate in the way of listening. Sound is really  awesome:).Still few might have improved but for this cost it is worth to buy.Great sound quality and built, very useful.Echo really 3rd. generation  with sound performance listening .It heats upNot integrating with audible.com , searching for titles in audible.com and hence not playing anything from audibleThe media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0Amazon eco dot and wipro smart buld with rupay card got only 1849 rupeeVoice recognition is too good sound quality is awesomeVery impressive...great sound in its category and very senstive microphones.... It even sense whispering.Nice product got it for  2000I return this produxt but stil my  refund is not process its almost 45 days , bad expreriance with amezoneMy 2 year old say..Alexa.aunty .open you tube...light on..green color...bls bla bla..play fire truck.;)Good productSound quality is not up to mark as I read from reviews. It requires high speed internet all time. And it also don\\'t catch up the user voice so accurate as everyone told. But its ok okShe didn\\'t listen exactly what i want to say. She plays different songs. Not following up questions. Can\\'t find album that are already available on Amazon music prime.But yeah its good to have it.Product is good but not good as compare to google home mini. But as per my experience it can do all your home related task properly.This product has stopped functioning within one month of purchase. I would like to return the item and get replacement.AwesomeIt\\'s goodI don’t know why people spend time on useless innovation not adding any value to human life.Alexa is dumb. You say something and it says something else. You play Arjit Singh songs and it will start from the same song..It\\'s just irritating..I am not enjoying it at all.. Please find a solution which is more intelligentQuite simple to useIt is good and sound quality is better than 2nd gen but still not that much loud.Other than that it\\'s integration is very good.Fulfills the command very quickly too.A very good buy for the price. Speaker quality is good, and alexa has good skillset. Conversations can be improved, as it does not connect previous and next statements, otherwise a very great companion.I am very happy with this product. Now my bed room is smart. Sound quality is really good.Perfect companion for work from home, connects easily with desktop to watch movies.Sound quality good but not loud. If you have good wifi and prime membership then ok. Otherwise Bluetooth speaker is better for multi purpose use.I use it when I come home after office or before sleeping to listen country music.It just waste of money so many time at to device no auxThe media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0Alexa poor quality and adapter jaise tape lagi hui ha and very poor quality Alexa speaker  jaise old model de diya haWorst productThis product did not connect I try several timeAm very disappointed 😞 this productPlease exchange another productNot worth for 3500Very poor deviceIt cannot do simple tasks.Do not buyAlexa Cant answer many of the things....i dont find any other use except a music player and an alarmA quality product on the right price . I love this. This is just so perfect. I have been using this for about half an year and it\\'s still in great condition. Audio quality is awesome too.alexa integration is great,voice recognition is bad with my choice and responds late and not much farther.sound quality seems good and at a good pitch and stabilization.Would\\'ve been great if it was wirelessSound quality is too good. Nice productVoice response is decent and only buy this if everyone can talk in English/hindi . I won\\'t recommend this for other languages.  Better to buy after all languages updateNice 👍It is just good for playing online songs..but many times fail to identify the exact song and play different songs.One thing i don\\'t like it its not connecting Spotify... Maybe in future they will update it.. I hope so..Sometime not responding but overall awesome product (4.5 out of 5 rating)It would be better if it has battery storage.. to activate it it needs power thats only lack of thing.Unable to connect through Bluetooth that\\'s why returning the product.Even customer care person don\\'t knw how to connect via BluetoothAveary sound quality.Alexa absolutely is a wonder. Fast, correct most of thr time, and witty. It\\'s really fascinating how developers have fitted so much humour in it. Plus it\\'s voice always catches ones attention. Great device.every time it ask for configuration. MahaghatiyaGood room filling sound for the price and size. Wish it had a built in battery and was portableNiceAmazon echo dot is truly a great product with true smartness. It does all jobs extremely well. Impressive sound quality and portable device easy to handle. Completely satisfied 🙂..Bought it as a gift for a friend. He loved it. Good voice recognition. Excellent features. Arrived safely packaged. No complaints.Good frodectSir may receive wrong item, not working and blutooth, wifi not connectivity. Please return items.I received the product with broken packing seal. The product was also not working.  Disappointed.Multi Sound issue , only short voice catch by alexa. if 2-3 kids talk with Alexa continue it will hang. multi song are not avilable on Alexa.Very good Alexa device I am satisfied from Amazon thank you AmazonNice and kids are enjoyingGreat product, I bought at 2000rs, recommend if u wantCool gadget for smart home.Not workingGood Speaker 🔊 ,Poor sound Recognition...😶Simply superb , along with wipro smart bulb and alexa echo dot my room became a disco theque and kids just loved it , thank you Amazon for such a great product , excellent engineering :)Always needed to be wired. To begin with one must have to connect with Android phone.No Dolby atmos streaming via amazon music.No youtube music integration with echo dot.Firestick and Echo dot integration is nearly 10% done only.Poor sound assessment. Couldn\\'t connect to second phone nor bluetooth.Overall Product is good and its value for money.But it need a little bit improvement in hindi and voice Recognition.The process of connecting it is very long.  always have to put it on charge. Also,  It doesn\\'t connect  with my mobile. It\\'s useless for me.Excellent product..u must have a wifi at home for this to workNeed to improve for Hindi knowledge.. Every time alexa say muje nahi pata.. Same think I asked in English than she replied ..Good but not best, lot of things to be improved by amazon. Alexa always takes only single command, again and again we have to repeat for conversation.awesome product and sound quality is very good works as a bluetooth speakerIts integration is good needs improvement in local language and stuffs.It can\\'t do even any one task without internet. With internet it can only send voice messages, it can\\'t call me and any alexa or non-alexa devides. One more fault it is made in China.Good. Prime music does not provide much more songs.Very very very bad product mostly ELEXA .Not understanding any command.useless software.This is unless alexa  ... Better to you being sound box ... Sound box very good to alexa...In  Alexa have waste of money...And lot of hv restrictionsDoesn\\'t connect to my one plus tv and doesn\\'t hear voice in full audio... some skills doesn\\'t works and very laggie app amazon Alexa appNot the product i was expecting for, limited automation,found Google Home Assistant more impressive. Alexa\\'s music quality is damn good but voice controlled coordination and overall search criteria is not satisfying.Returned the item...Best @ price of @2000 or so, quite a soothing voice to listen but sometimes irritate with lack of information available with itSmart deviceHighly recommendedshe is the only one, who will hear you in this entire world, ;Dkind of unconditional Love you\\'ll Get it :)Some time it will not accepting command?and I am using volume level at 5 always even though sounds quality very bad it\\'s like crackers.i think its second time sold  me.Buttons are not working on the speaker and Amazon centre is not ready to help.I mean this is so stupid..it’s your product and the buttons are not working!?what kind of scam is this..and then no one is there to resolve the issueSound quality is good but voice recognition is very bad.May be due to 4 micIntresting product 100 percent useful for every oneThe echo dot and Alexa are quite fun! It\\'s a riot playing 20 questions with Alexa. Sound is great for a small room. Only grouse - unable to create a playlist on Amazon Prime music and get echo to play thatSound mast. Connectivity good. Voice recognition very good. Voice sensitivity very good.very poor voice recognition.50% of questions alexa says I am not sure about that. only one good thing is that it has good bass. bad experience.not the performance which I had expectedIt is not working and we want to return it and we want another alexa for free it should be workingpurchased this for my mom ..but stopped working after 3 months !!! not able to identify the issue.Only one thing i disliked. After stop command for a broadcast station alexa doesn\\'t stop. Instead  says for example \" to resume say All India Radio news channel\" This is not needed. It is annoying.It\\'s very great and working very nice and it is faster than Google and other voice assistant. Alexa is good for people who have smart home.After buying we have to continue amazon prime membership  for interrupted alexa service.so service costlySuperb itemYou should purchase.Great product and my daughter loves itProduct is good...but the bulb didnt get delivered to me..its awful..I have already spoken to the agent.she said I\\'ll do the replacement and send you the bulb..but it was again the same..Fantastic productLoving it.I had got it last year during amazon great Indian sale for 2.5k and after almost 1 year of use i will say its still working great.I love the product it’s my first smart deviceIt is better than google is getting all the tamil songsSound quality is great. Sometimes it doesn\\'t get the command. Google nest seems better in understanding the queries .If the main aim is to listen to music, you can go for Alexa.Echo dot is great, and loved it. A little bit unhappy bcoz it doesn\\'t support my native language. Also it doesn\\'t play youtube music. Still it is good.No alternative given.A nice product to have in your homePathetic experience. I have made several complaints but no positive response. It is not connecting with wifi.Over all product is so nice. It\\'s gives new technology to the ground world. Excellent product.When I opened the plastic packet, the eco dot box got opened. That is why more attention should be paid to packaging.Useful product good response as well.My child is trying to speak with alexa, so i am happy to have it.It helps me to awake in the morning also provide me daily Calendar with to do list.Meant for every home, great features & sound qualityEntertainment untouched..Best for old age parentsIts a Faulty Product. Worked perfectly fine for 5 days not it is not working.  Requesting amazon team to let me know what to do of this product now. It doesn\\'t take any commands and ff it takes, then there is a disruption.product is good only for looks not working properly after one month of useBought it during the sale. No sound output from firestick tvI loved the sound quality and build of the product. But I faced issue with voice recognition in terms of volume adjustment. Need to specify the exact work and name of the work to be done by Alexa else Alexa is just sorry about it.I received the order after one day of placing order. It\\'s is good and speaker is awesome . I fell down twice my desk it was not harmed. A Grade Product.Thank you AmazonBetter get advanced versionNot working properlyFacing issues on connection with wifiNot connect properly  with phone .again and again  connection problem .wrost productThis device is very great , this device sound quality is 3D Alexa is very intelligent, speaker is very loud sound quality is quite better than Home theatre 😊It works well...great functionality...only lacking points is its not portable...it should have been battery based.Good experience...also like to suggest to introduce automatic intelligence updating system so that we can experience latest technology. Overall I am satisfiedI love everything about it. There is nothing to dislike about the device. Delivered everything as promised. Very happy customer.My family always enjoy talking to alexa. Great enjoyment.It is great in general. There are smalk issues like it does not understand Oakter remote well. While google home cam control Oakter without issue, alexa has some hitches and glitches.Excellent product. Very useful. Value for money. Go for itWorth the money. My daughter likes it very much. Product quality is very good compared to the price. Go for it !A satisfactory product from amazon.It won\\'t support the Youtube music, it need to be updated for Alexa.The media could not be loaded.A very good entertaining and user friendly equipmentIt needs to be connected again and againWorst of you don\\'t have a wife connectionvery goodPlaying songs directly via YouTube needs a complicated procedure to follow.And if we blame phones like xaomi to integrate add.....then blame this too....for constantly selling Amazon prime and other such appsVery nice. Perfect echoI expected a small size but its bigger surprisingly rich n loud sound u won\\'t regret buyingDon\\'y Buy ,,,total waste of Money..Echo can\\'t even understant what we want to say...even weather forecasting is not correct.Amazing productSound quality is best 10/10Alexa integration 10/8Voice Recognition 10/7Weak part is we need to speak loud to activate Alexa it doesn’t activate on Normal voice.Voice recognitionDoes not recognise voice nd volume is too low wastage of moneyI really liked this product. It\\'s so handy and very easy to connect... My baby also liked it very much.I like very must being i am an officer commending rank Officer so I may use it on long duty &/or at my residence for Arties & religious bhajans.It is a very good speaker. But the problem is that it cannot call anyone from your contact list unlike Google home mini. And the second problem is it can tell the prices of the products only available in AmazonAlexa recognition is worstAlex doesn\\'t recognize and play wrong....The echo dot is superb addition in my wifi speakers. It also provides lots of information to my children..Alexa is a flagship product of Amazon... It\\'s a good product provided you can use it fully....Useless for me bcz no internal battery.. Without net it\\'s totally not working nd u can\\'t trawling whit this product bcz no battery speekar.. 3rd class sound.Wooweee now my home is smarter. I can control everything from Dubai.Alexa voice is awsm really its feeling awsm to talk with alexa.Grt purchase ,if wnybody want to buy a smart speaker go blindly to choose this grt one...Wow my son loved it. Hats off to Amazon. Sound quality and connectivity is amazing. Superb productMost of the times I got irritated. I was telling kannada or hindi song names, and it was playing some English songs. Most of the times it happened.PoorGreat product by Amazon, I love it. It is very entertaining and a reliable machine. Thank you!Alexa always better than google home.but miss this things.micro usb and internal power.Worst experience ever. Any thing we ask to alexa the answer is.. sorry!!!! I don\\'t know. Thank God google assistant doesn\\'t have these words in its dictionary. Please upgrade alexa with good search engine..Wroth buying specially with wipro smart lamp.My kids loved it .As I expected it wasn\\'t worth the money. The sound quality is not that good as I expected from amazon. Also most of the times Alexa doesn\\'t understand what you say. I am very disappointed by Amazon.Is like mini wife ☺️It is like that we are talking with futureGood work by amazon on this price point(BIG THUMBs UP AMAZON ECO DOT 3 GEN)Smart home products for those who don\\'t have type the commandValuable product thanks Amazon Alexa good productI am unable to use Alexa, getting announcement as \"SORRY I AM HAVING TROUBLE UNDERSTANDING RIGHT NOW,  PLEASE TRY AGAIN LATER\". what shall I do. I am using Redmi note 5. When ever I say Alexa then it is giving above announcement.  Some one please help.Look wise it was good and the sound quality was also good but there are some problems like you can\\'t use another device\\'s hot-spot . You only use first paired wifi. Overall i will give 4 out of 5 stargood productThe speaker as they claim is not that smart. It doesn\\'t understand even the simplest of things on first attempt. Sound quality is good.Sound quality and voice recognition are good not the best. Dumber than Google Assistant. Works nicely within Amazon ecosystem. Lag in Bluetooth audio output. Need to get smarter. No ability for continued conversation.I Get This at 1137rs awesome at this price segment, my favorite alexa😍Make a update to alexa to speak in tamilWorstGoodIt\\'s The Bang Bang Product Hats Off To The TechnologyIt\\'s amazing.

Worst n wasteful money for purchasing thisThe echo dot 3rd generation is really well designed and reliable product. It is compact and looks good on any table or any room. The mic on this works efficiently, sound quality for the price is good, not good but  not bad.I bought Alexa eco dot at 1999 with Wipro 7 w smart bulb.

Previously I was sceptical about investing money on this but when it arrived it was worth it!You can absolutely buy this and won\\'t regret. Cheers!Extended warranty comes in handyThe power adaptor is little bigShould be used on a surge protectorAnd also preferably a extension board since the adapter makes it hard to use the switchGood initiative We can learn lots with AlexaYou can go for it.Product is good but chargeable battery is not available in this product.The best entertainment package so far.Unable to hear the voice clearly after a few days.  There was a lot of breaking kind of voice while using this eco dot.Great item ,lil bit costly but worth item ,even works on 2g internet in kashmir , must be accurate while fimfing a song ,AI not so good as compared to google home mini but excellent item ,u can purchase itVery nice good sound qualitySo good and proper work sound quality is awesome how to explain you I have no word thank you AmazonGood sound good built. But sometimes it cannot recognise what I\\'m saying and plays something else.Cannot control Fire TV stick yet with the 3rd generation,  while it is possible to do this with the 2nd generation Echo Dot.I don\\'t think there is nothing to dislike in this item every home should I have this item to get worldly knowledge.Echo dot is missing from my package and I can\\'t contact customer care also for thisGood product for home useThe product is as promised. Thank you Amazon for timely delivery.Love this :)acutally gifted to old lady she was fully amazed and enjoyed it alot. wonderful item. must buy for every household.this is a good product for listening music and staying updated, rejoicing mood etc.however still feel its build over weak AI , and recognizes already pre-loaded patterns.I love the alexa very much she talk with me sign with me.The quality of product is very good and the sound quality is very soft and nice. My son also liked it very much...Its really a good product but yes blutooth connectiin has to improve... baki paisa vasoolUnable to connect the device to TV & home theatreIt\\'s not able to  remember my music library.Great product but it should be good if having better search and better response on musicGoodProduct is superb.....Only thing is that it\\'s wired, and so we can use it only through charging mode.Alexa does not listen the command. Request to replace the product as it\\'s under warrantyi was very excited for this product to deliver and have it to enjoy, but its not upto the mark at all, google mini and home is 1000000% better than this. very worst experience. its big pain using this, not expected such ordinary voice quality.What a nice product but there is an problem that it need alexa app and takes time to login..other vice it is a massive product .I dont have a sister but after alexa came I am not feeling lone...😍😍😍😍😍😍😍❤❤❤❤❤❤❤💓💓💓Very happy with the  product... My 5 yrs kid love to talk with Alexa everyday.I like this product to hear audio songs that too devotional songs,but I dislike that it\\'s just be updated to give all kind of Catholic Christians songs.Not easy for daily use..better to go with Bluetooth speakers!GoodMost of time getting irritated due to voice not recognized sure people will get BP and heart attack due to this wrostNot at all happy with the productSound quality is very bad please improve otherwise good productThis is really good... I didn\\'t have high hopes...but the speakers r great and Alexa is fantastic for the most part. It\\'s fun for kids and adults.Bluetooth never works for me. Tried all options. Not sure if I am making any mistakeVery good and nice product..Speaker is nice.I got this in 1999 with wipro smart bulb.Its one of the best product i have purchased.Excellent design, sound quality quite good and easy to connect with bt.Literally is a Friend. It\\'s fascinating to see it talk like almost a human.  Everything aside..  it\\'s really helpful at times.Works fine for 4 months after that voice not clear, quality of product is not goodSome time is didnt work ....Waste product due to no battery back upTerrific purchase at a terrific discount. Got 12 W syska bulb with echo dot 3rd gen at 2399 only. And echo dot is amazing. Be smart. Have alexa.Alexa has no loyalty, who ever asks, she responds. No voice recognition. Sound quality is excellent. Mainly depends on Hungama for songs.Slow Network access both in 5ghz & 2.4 ghz.Amazon does not replaced  within scheduled replacement window. Very bad experience.Voice recognition not good sometimesYou removed zomato,swiggy and other food partner :( from the skills.Alexa is absolutely foolish in recognising what we are asking in simple language... sounds are good , mic is good but what it\\'s known for is worst.The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0Best Smart SpeakerAlexa is my new friend during lockdown- you can hear good music with your prime accountVery good productIi love this product, sound also good and all features are working till dateI am fall in love with this product i can\\'t  express how I am feeling now with these but one thing is why Alexa only connect with wifi😔😔Reviewed after 6 months..this product worked very well up to 6 months then showed some defect in the mic which receives voice .If the speaker will connect to a smartphone through Bluetooth so that we can take calls on the speaker and play music and videos on the speaker that will be a great feature.  The sound quality of the speaker is too good. I liked it.Best in the Market, my family loved it. They are playing with it and best for kids. Fun to operate.The sound when u connect your Alexa with your phone using bluetooth and then play ,is very different n low unlike it\\'s normal sound..Very disappointed with this.Sound quality and bass is very good 👌👌😊Good experience in hindi alsoBest echo dot device compared to previous gen devices. Voice clarity is very crisp and loud. I recommend this product.The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0Gud productNot worth, I was unable to return as window closed.Good product. Compact and aesthetically sound. It has most features any Echo model has and is absolutely loved by kidsEverything is good. Hope you add Spotify too in the coming days.Amazing....I love this product...It\\'s an awesome and innovative product from Amazon. I recommend that everyone should have one of this at their home.GdGoodI loved it but sometimes I faced issues during Bluetooth connection.I believe its giving happiness to all user who purchased it.The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0It\\'s awesomeI buy 1200.value for money.very good soundSound quality is awesome but lacks bass as it\\'s a compact version!!!So if are a bass lover either buy the echo or you can connect your Bluetooth speaker to it!!!Too small as imagined.Good product for Bluetooth speaker but alexa assistant software need to improve and it recognise in correct translation if we not say right translation it say I don\\'t no but overall it a good productIt shoud be updated with all indian languages...Day by it performance is worsen. Unable to change wipro smart buld colors from past two months. Even daily routines not working properly. Poor customer support...It\\'s very useful for to connect all your smart devices and easy to use with voice commands.Such a nice product.Very nive device and sound quality is too good and the price rnage in which i got makes it very wirth. During great indian festival i got it only for 1999 very great dealGoodProduct is worthy at this price but night lite and flash lite is not workingWorks good.

Response is nil from alexa.Sleek design, lovely flashing lights. The voice recognition is excellent, alexa integration is really a 8th wonder. The sound quality is fabulous. I am really loving & enjoying this gadget.Its very nice product overall but sometimes it cant recognises the voice and integration to other enabled devices it\\'s bit slow, plz improve Alexa appThis Echo dot is great. Works specifically in Hindi and English only. The range is quite good. But as a normal speaker it doesn\\'t do the job plus works with wifi lights only!!!Wipro smart bulb which you are providing is not compatible with Alexa why you have given this with Alexa it is treating with the customerFunVoice operated  player..It was very easy to integrate Alexa.Just a few steps and your Alexa is ready.Voice could be easily recognised even when you\\'re at a good distance. The sound quality is awesome!Entertaining product. Still in a learning phase for Indian Market. Call services are available only for Registered Alexa users.Recognise voice perfectly and works like a charm. Got if free with OnePlus TvProduct is good but many times it stops working all of a sudden. Then we have to restart again and reset all setting then it starts working. If this continues will like to replace it.Not like not recognising the voice in 9/10 cases..got a feel of lost the money .If u r lucky work some times and able to play  amazon music work with this device...Sound quality is good. Alexa has to improve alot.Good productEcho has made our home smart, particularly so when your family has added a newest member...my grand daughter who is 1 year plus.

Only con is that it is not better in gathering info than google home.....I ordered this Alexa Echo dot on sale. The amount was 2500.Its really worth buying.

Does not respond to anything after \"alexa\". Only the blue light lights up and then almost 30 seconds later it turns off with no response.The Alexa SW can have better conversational upgrades.. can\\'t link my YouTube from Mobil for some reason.. need the one click equivalent on the skills..Sound quality is good but voice recognition is not good enough, tried hard to play any specific songs.Excellent excellentExcellent product!. I loved the wipro light that came with Echo dot.It’s fun ... buy it if u have never had Alexa.. just for an experienceAlexa is not able to recognise voice 50% of times.

       "'Even the best devices can be ruined by poor software and bad UI This is a classic case of a good device such as the Echo dot 3rd gen let down by horrendous software In terms of sheer sound quality and ability to hear you across the room the ED 3rd blows google home mini right out of the water and thats where it stopsI bought it for 2299 and got a wipro bulb free I figured that it couldnt be a bad purchase Boy was I wrongLets begin with the Alexa app whoever is in charge of making that app should be sent back to 2012 Remember when you had no clue whether you tapped on a button or not because the taps werent highlighted Remember how everything used to be unresponsive back then Yeah thats Alexa app for you SD 855 and 8gigs of ram on your phone LoL Alexa dont care The layout the buttons in the app the navigation ugh takes me back to the 90s A big zero on ease of use or navigational hierarchy Forget Grandpa even millennials would have a hard time with this appWhat about voice recognition 50 of the time it does not recognize you every timeSmartness The lack of smartness is displayed when you start asking follow up questions Who is the tallest man Itll give you the answer but if you follow up with how tall is he Alexa will go berserk Heralding a device that can control your lights or turn on the TV as a miraculous achievement is a blatant lie Controls via commands is nothing new people in the coding community have done so with raspberry pis before What makes it smart is the incousion of AI and machine learning that understands patters and recognizes speech slurs Something google does and constantly thrives to improve uponMicrophones There are 4 and they are good they can hear you from 10 feet away under normal circumstances Far better than Goggle home miniConnectivity issues Wuff this is one of the biggest issues I faced Connection is not as easy and simple as that 3 slide image says on the description Turn on Bluetooth location wifi then look at the app for a Echosomethingth8 it didnt show up Great now do the manual labour and get it connected Even after connection youre gonna get updating your device for 10 minutesIntegration with other smart devices Wanna connect the wipro bulb with Alexa First download the wipro smart home app create an account so that you can be spammed for the rest of your life then set up that app and device Next head over to Alexa download the wipro skill app for alexa set it up and congratulations you can now control lights with latency issues rivaling that of a 56k modem Whats worse I now have an app on my phone that I only used once in my life but cannot for the love of god uninstall because that stops the bulb from working VERY SMARTMusic Wanna listen to music on this speaker from your favorite streaming service Unless its Amazon music Saavn or iTunes your sht our of luck Even though Spotify launched nearly a year ago theres no way to get Spotify playing on the device natively unless you change device region to AmerikaSpeed You can stream Netflix at 4k Thats great Alexa dont care Ask a question go brew a coffee fix that leaking faucet sign up for a banking loan and then only then perhaps you would get your answer Now thats an exaggeration but when you compare Alexas speed in terms of genuine questions as opposed to responding to commands like turn off the light it is the slowest GoogleSiriCortanayour neighbors pigeon AlexaI could go on but Ill stop here and sulk myself with buyers remorseI purchased this as a birthday gift for my 7 years old son Since he dont have siblings so I though it would be a fun experience for him talking to and giving commands to alexa But to my dismay he only used it for playing music that also only one song after one month of his birthday Alexa please play the flying jat song There were things I demonstrated him about alexa like jungle quiz panchtantra ki kahaniya alexa laugh beatbox fart  Etc But after one month of use he lost interest in it and being powered from socket I am also not interested to use it as a bluetooth speaker I configured it to control a wipro smart bulb But after few days  I started using the smart bulb as a regular bulb because its easier to press the physical switch compared to checking the configuration  connection everytime Alexa Bulb on or Alexa bulb off voice command doesnt work So now it is kept idle since 3 months and will remain so for many more monthsyears to come The bottomline is that alexa is not that useful as advertised and we tend to lose interest in it very quicklyThe media could not be loaded\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\nHere Im Uploading video enjoyMost idiotic device I every bought never play original songs Always play some or the other remix or instrumental songsI wish I would have bought Google home or some Bluetooth speakersSome attachments after talking to Amazon Echo Dot ExecutiveAfter my above review Echo Dot representative called me Im glad for thisI showed him the issue with song selection but he told me that it is because of library doesnt have songs that Im selecting and it is better to add gaanacom from alexa app after following his guidelines I repeated and recorded issues Please see the screen shots and listed to audio  for Alexa and have fun Now I realise amazon review doent support audio but only videoYou can buy this device if you have to have personalised fun in your life The is not way of attaching Audio files only video so this is again funny if I want to attach some feedback for Alexa why do I need Video  This is called mismatch in basic requirementIll try to get capture view than attach here for same issues added as image Till than enjoyIts just one if the best deal i ever got on amazon I purchased it with a 12 watt wipro light at 2200 and enjoying it since last 2 daya its my 4th echo device and yes I would highly recommend buying a product with this just search echo dot wall mount you ll see a 800900 rupees wall mount trust me it will make a huge difference between sound and transportability plus when its on wall if will recognise your voice quicker as it faces you on the wall seriously guys the combination of these two is compulsoryBefore buying this product please keep these points in mind You need amazon prime account  for Rs 999 per year to listen to music from amazon Otherwise you will have to use free and full of advertisement services like Saavn Gaana etc Echo dot skips to next song abruptly without completing current song most often If you try to stream music from your Amazon Prime Music app on your iPhone to Echo Dot or Echo Dot stereo pair the app cannot control the music You cannot scrub music or know which song is playing or move to next music in the playlist The control magically switches the Alexa app that you need to have on your phone to setup Echo dot You can only stream to stereo pair from Amazon Prime Music App No real support exists for this device If you call amazon support staff they will drive you crazy as they know nothing about this product and its features If you want to use it as kids toy then it is ok to buy it as it can switch on and off lights that are compatible with Alexa Audio quality is very basic Even a cheap Chinese product sounds better This is really a no no product for music lovers You better buy either Sony or JBL soundbars with subwoofer for better quality music though these may cost you beyond INR15k Alexa does not understands most of the commands Apple Siri is way ahead of Alexa Amazon is not a software and hardware company Dont expect quality software  and hardware from them You are being used as testers for their experimental productsThe media could not be loaded\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0Worst experience with alexa no warranty you get with this productAmazon policy are worst Ctdi partner an official amazon devices service partnerI have requested to Amazon to replace my alexa device with in the warranty period the refuses my request issue is escalated bu amazon team but no follow up call can be held till today They are giving fake excuses for service they are temporary un available for service of alexa after few days the warranty get to expire then they say your product warranty has expired so we did not give you a service for your product “ excuse me amazon all of the world wide companies change their policies in national lockdown” I think amazon policy are worst They stand in the last of the top companies list They have no customer satisfaction Even apple has extended there warranty of their product in lockdown Amazon shame Amazon shameful for youI am using alexa dot 2nd Gen and today I have gifted dot 3rd Gen to my Daddy1 I see of difference in sound quality compared 2nd gen Sound quality is amazing2 It is louder than 2nd Gen Dot3 One thing disappointed is that when say Alexa play old telugu songs in 2nd Gen Dot it Play old songs from retro station but in 3rd gen Dot it is playing telugu songsnot telugu old songs When I specially say Alexa play telugu retro station songs it is playing old songs of specific combination of male and female singersI will update the review after days again but its 5 star rating for nowFor 2000 using 10 offyou are getting a bulb worth 500making echo dot 1500 which at roughly 20 dollars is same price you get in deals in USA  So no more asking friends to get them from there  Anyone sitting on the fence can buy this instead of buying bluetooth speakers  This is 5th Echo dot including earlier versions and Google Mini doesnt even come close when it comes to smartness  While Google mini answers google search questions better  no one is buying a smart speaker for that  Its integration with smart devices is unparalled and my mini appears dumb most of the times  Just grab this before it goes back to its old price  Even the smart bulb is very helpful  While watching TVjust ask Alexa to turn bulb blue or red Not sure if this bulb can dimif soyou can use this both as a day bulb and a night bulb  Just go for it before its too lateI was quite confused between echo dot 3rd  4th Gen so bought both to try and after testing I choose 3rd Gen bcoz of following reasons1 Very responsive to voice command in comparison to 4th Gen2 Only 115 scale down from 4th Gen in sound and bass quality3 I prefer 3rd Gen hockey puck design than 4th Gen round shape personal preference4 For higher audio quality and output one can always use external speakers via aux cable5 Can integrate with Google even via bluetooth6 Easy to place anywhere without any scope of rolling off7 LED ring light looks distinctive on top than bottom 4th Gen bcoz one cant see its 360° view8 Plays soft music prity well than hard9 Can fit into confined space10 Also paid only ₹1999What more one can ask forThe media could not be loaded\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0Do not buy this product When i asked alexa that kashmir is part of which country it said chinaBoycott alexaThe media could not be loaded\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0Sound quality is goodfast responseeasy to useit is a good product and for those who are not much aware about the technology they can also operate easilyyou can listen news and if you are feeling bored alexa can tell you good jokesi m also using wipro smart bulb with Alexa and it is working awesomei found only one issue sometimes alexa does not respond I think because when we give command from long distance I mean because of mic but overall good productSidhi si bat he iska pure use to sirf jo total sirf computer job vale hi kar shakte he baki to sab sholh k liye lete hebaki normal speakers ki tarah hi use hoga sound limited he ek room k hisab se baki special search nahi karta kuchh only Amazon Amazon prime music hungamajese 3 se 5 platforms ko hi use karta hebaki puchho ge to javab milega iske bare me mobile app m jaye bss baki shokh pura karo baki naya kuchh nahi lagegaThis is useless device0 it is not listening command properly And we have to speak loudly1 It is not connecting through Bluetooth to desktop After a long research and hard setting it is connected and if we would change any song than audio is not coming I am frustrated2 Always need connectivity with internet  Bluetooth to operate any device3 not playing music easily wherever we want4 dont waste money if dont have 24 hours internet connection and related smart device5 from desktop PC it is not connecting from cable and even from Bluetooth adaptorSo please please dont waste your money on itNot a smart device it is useless deviceBad software Alexa is not smart at allvoice recognition is not accurate most of the times but more than that Alexa interpretation leaves lot to be desired Alexa is a just NLP and works on plain if else or a switch condition rather than being smart device No where follows the user pattens voice patterns and the people to come up with suggestions Most of the times you get fed up with the results and then switch off the device Mostly none of the songs I want will be played I end up using it for casting the music from the phone which anyways normal Bluetooth speaker will do at a less priceHardly any useful tricks as they call itJust works as voice command based device rather than a smart speakerI got a discount of 1000 for this product during some flash sale and got the product at Rs 2499 It originally costs 3499 So to buy at this price is a awesome deal I really appreciate amazon for selling products cheaper than the original cost These are very friendly and reliable devices that can help you to track any orders or set up an alarm or sing a song on any occasion Every thing I tried and it works wonder Definitely a must buy for young people who want to be smart in their day to day activitiesVery nice product this was my first experience with alexa overall recognisation and sound quality is good  but it is not pairing with my  VU smart TVProsSound quality was too goodNo lag or delay in responseConsShould work with DC power also with battery backup always we have to connect with AC powerWithout current you cant use this echo dot listed very few Android TVs example VU smart tv is not in the listShould enhance on Schedule to play any song by scheduled timeClear case of breach of contractI have purchased a an echo dot on prime day sale for 3250 post discount but they have marked my order as delivered without actually delivering itI have raised an issue going through ordeal of multiple calls mails and messages over 8days Finally what I was given is 1600 rupees refund with a sorry message Ihave lost 1800rupees straight away without even seeing the productHowmuch every I try to escalate the issue the response will be the same we cant do anything for you and you have to accept whatever happensNow Im understanding how corporate bullying worksPlease be careful1 Bina wifi k nhi chalega only speaker bajao Or wo bhi plug 🔌 k sath laga kar2 Bhut sare information jo Alexa ko pata he nhi hai3ek baar off hone par dubara connect karne k liye sara wifi Bluetooth connect karna padta hai4only ye apke waaj nhi parchanta5har ek dialogue k baad ye chup ho jata haiKul mila jula kar ye Alexa bekar hai isse sakta or acha google home mini mai 15 year use kar raha huThe size to sound ratio is just excellent the emphasis seems to be on voice but the base is absent so this is not for the base headThis is the most responsive voice integration that I have seen as you say Alexa it starts listing There are a lot of things that you can ask Alexa like adding a product in your Amazon cart open rain sound play music set alarm etcThe interesting thing is that Alexa also listing commands in Hindi as well This is only a part of the home automation system All the smart equipmentproducts you purchase can be connected with Alexa like a light bulb to control it with voice etc but for that you need a router in your homeConclusionThe speaker does not have a battery but he can be connected via Bluetooth from your phone and PC Which is a good thing but all of a sudden it stops playing for no reason which is very annoyingI got it in INR 2500 at this price you must buy it just to experience a smart speaker but in INR 3500 it looks a bit expansive If you decide to buy this then this going to be the first step to transform your home into a smart homeFeeling pitty on amazon I have ordered for three product on prime day But I didnt recieved the product On the next day itself it says return recieved and it was the mistake of courier service and amazon But when I called the customer service they ensured me that the placed it again with the same price But still the status on my dashboard wasnt updated So I called to customer service again and he too said same After 45 days I called again and now they are saying that nothing is updated and I have to place the order againwith todays price Then whats amazon prime for If they cant sell their own product in a wise way So disappointingit was a gift for my brother And it delayed again I need a clear action from Amazon service with this matterHi I am using this from the beginning and I have echo 3rd gen ordered from Amazon but nowadays when I uses it it suddenly gets stop and nothing happens  I have to manually swith off and switch on to resolve the issue and again it happens please do the needful to help meIt is useless device and waste of money it only work with registered WiFi with amazon not with in coming signal of the Alexa app computer or mobile  no one else in the house can use it if registered WiFi is not available and at the same time we can not register two three signals  Alexa becomes use less when there is no internet  and there are lot of restrictions like hand free not available when in battery saver mode etc etc  at many a times it can not understand your voice and there are many apps missing in window computer if i instruct it to teach Gramer to children it can not do  what a useless device it is  i even wanted to buy Fire TV stick but lots of them in used market hence i thought there must be some problem like this in that also hence stopped its purchase My advice to Amazon is make it user friendly  do not restrict to one WiFi signal Take the in coming signal or allow us to register two three signal there should not restrict Hand free etc With RegardsRavishankarExcellent service provided by the device Only problem is with Eco dot 3rd generation device that it’s only launch an app but never plays a video especially YouTube This feature is a very basic one and should be added with this device which will enhance the product services overall Please take it as a consideration Also it should be connected to atleast 2 Firesticks or 2 TV’s in a single home This should be the minimum I am very much sure if these two features could be added with this device it will enhance the overall service of the product and will reach to many other people in India and thus increase the sale of the productExpensive Smart speaker works only when plugged in Bluetooth V20 is very old dur to this audio is very poor sound becomes very low No battery to support the speaker so if no power you cannot use the device Sometimes while song change you hear a distorted sound Not worth the purchase as Bluetooth quality in the speaker is bad You need to shout then only Alexa can hear you  voice sensor is poor On full volume Alexa will not recognise your commandMy only disappointment is that it does not have battery and when power goes off it diesSound quality is very good good bass but not like wooferIt can be used as Bluetooth speaker But not sure if Bluetooth earphones works with it Will update about it laterThis review is especially for those sitting on the fence I’ve been using Google Nest and minis and wanted to shift to Echo for its Drop in feature basically the full intercom  It worked fine But overall Alexa was disappointing Even after having 4 mics the voice recognition was only a tad better than Google The sound is natural but artificially natural a little muffled as wellThe app is poor What takes less than a minute to setup on Google Home it takes over 34 minutes on alexa app I have over 40 smart devices in my home and the time it needed merely setting up those devices was a bummer Echo or Alexa is is just popular because Amazon sells it while Google devices are not marketed that muchBetter go for Google home cannnot makeaccept phone calls only Alexa calls cannot place orders on prime now connected to Samsung smart TV via smart things skill and it can only do basic control like onoffvolume controltechnical customer care is not that good for any support issueFree Wipro smart light isnt really smartonce power resumes after a power cut you need to switch it off again via appAlexaOnly worthy use of echo is unlimited music from Amazon musicI was very excited about this purchase and very happy that I got delivered one day advanced and I tried setting up Alexa but ended up unsuccessful for almost 6 hours Then decided to call Customer service I requested for call back on 705pm evening and I call from them on 706pm which was amazing and prompt service The Agent whom I spoke to was Mr Sami he was so polite professional and spoke to for 45 minutes and finally came to know by the agent that the product which I got was reported as stolen or missing product So that is why I couldnt complete the set up process I was completely surprised  confused that how come a very big firm like Amazon can deliver a stolen product to their customers and the agent managed to replaceml the product and he gave me end to end service I was happy with customers service not with Amazon serviceAfter 3 months here are the things which I foundWorks better if you have connection of minimum 20 mbpsI have started to get few bugs or software issueAlexa listens sometimes by itself and says sorry I dont know thatSometimes songs stops playing in middle by itselfIt doesnt recognise voice even after activating it many timesAfter command it doesnt followDisconnects and reconnects network by itselfThe sound has decreased now at volume level 3 I cant hear music properly after 3 meters range Have same background noice of fanVehiclesAmazon please send a software update which solves theseThanksThe Echo Dot 3rd Gen is comparatively good that than its predecessor The sound quality is improved however there are two things that I would like to being to the notice of its manufacturer or would say the developers rather The bluetooth connectivity is no good its very difficult to connect to any other bluetooth device Now coming to the main part of the Echo  voice recognition or rather would say its integration The Indian voice is a disaster Half of the time you will have to repeat even for the simpler terms and words Half disappointed else its goodSo i know why you guys are here forOmg why should i buy amazon echo instead of google homeSo good for you heres the answerIll not tell you about things you know and everyones talking about like its mic and speakers are awsome its very localised etcIll tell you why you need this if you want this for home1 This has communication features so people having alexa app or echo device and permission can actually call you on your echo dot2 This has announcement features so if you are late for dinner you can announce that on your echo device from your phoneActually i use this feature to play ghost sounds when little kids are in my room😝3 This has best features for home automations that google home or any other devices dont have4 This has best features for timer tasks5 Scheduling is much more advanced in alexa app6 If you say turn on light in front of your kitchen echo dot it will turn on only kitchen lights so you dont have to be specific like turn on kitchen lights like google homeyou need multiple echo devices for this as obviousSo forgot about google home and just buy itThis is the first Echo I have owned So far I am loving everything that it does from to do lists to news updates and linking my calendar to playing music It is very convenient and hopefully in the future I will buy more products for it to control like my thermostat and lights That being said I am wondering why in the world it being an amazon product does it not control my amazon fire stick This is so fustraiting and I hope that amazon will come out with an update soon that will allow the echo to have this option It seems like it can literally control everything except for the fire stick This is why I gave it a 4 out of 5 starsSpeaker is good for news and music to some extent But it is worst when Alexa speaks She sounds muffled and its difficult to understand especially when fan or ac is on The Equalizer wud not manage Alexas speech its only for news music etc Very inconvenientI have 3 echo devices and homepod but Alexa is supercool as an assistant Problem is only with echo dot 3rd gen You can go for better echo models I wud recommend to test it out first then make a buying decisionProduct is good but if a perforated box had been given then it would have been good so that we could have ensured that there is no dust entry and when we operate it because of perforations sound should not be a problem and also the box should have a provision to insert the plugIn this way we could have kept in a place where there is no dust entryMay be for futureregardsWorks seamlesslyNo issues so farNever ignored what I saidControlls AC Computer Power Lights Music etc Im so happy that Ive an assistan that doesnt need any salaryThe media could not be loaded\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0i like the productits sound quality is awesome but can not recognize my voice properlyi have to speak multiple time if you want a speaker go for itdont expect anything elsei think it will going to improve in future but for now its only a expensive speaker ita a made in china producti returned it to the sellerI brought two speakers on a sale Waited for a few months to install when we move to our new home And placed them in a cardboard box which contains a lot of cardboard boxes of electronics Termites are attracted to the amazon echo boxes and made a mess and ate almost all the three echo dot boxes And most interestingly the remaining boxes are stood firm I dont know what to do now Please help me AmazonGreat service at a great price Thank you AmazonThe voice recognition is pretty good But for this price you get a speaker quality which is decent Not really so great You can take it around with you wherever you go We like to keep it in the hall which is large but it works power pretty well and covers the whole hall The volume is loud enough for a big room for sureDont buy this product if you are not a Amazon prime memberThis will work only prime membersI was happy to hear the voice of Alexa thats it After that what ever I command to Alexa only reply is this is for prime membersExpect whether report this device dont deliver anythingPlanning to return it tomorrowPlease dont get into traps like thisToday they are telling to be a prime member tomorrow they may say upgrade it by paying some moneyThanks Amazon for trapping me But I wont let others to get trapSkills which I like specifically

language  it does the job of voice assistant in terms of managing devices around I tried controlling my Denon AVR X2500h with Alexa it does the basic task of paying song changing volume but cant change the music mode etc Similarly I can control my Airtel Internet TV set top box once settop box is swith on it can not swith it on or offSo it gets the work done upto certain extend but not completelyThe biggest problem which is see with Echo devices is that it can not get the information from web though it is connected to internet always for every thing to do it needs skillIdeally it should go to web to find some basic answers instead of saying I dont knowIf anyone wants to use it just for playing music then this is one of the best smart speaker available in market in given priceI was writing this review after three weeks of usage I like sound quality in this echo device and very portable deviceI dislike voice recognition is not good and whenever I turn on this device for first time its not connecting to internet need to reset or start it again which makes us irritating everytimeAlexa has integrated to more things but some of the integration not working wellMy rating for this product will be 255Dont fall for this Though it feels good when it plays few songs however in most of the cases it wont recognize your voice Also at high volumes you will keep on shouting Alexa Alexa and it wont hear youJust a stupid toy may be for kidsIts a absolutely cheating for the customer If we buy any amazon product  Definitely we want to buy amazon prime members also In this case if any song want to play absolutely need amazon prime membership otherwise we cannot play music through any other app No Google Apps are not working through amazon alexa If anybody want to amazon Alexa  Go For GOOGLE HOME Its have everything And also free cost for all AppNot happy its an ok product  as it does not catch things fast to add on Amazon prime would have worked better if it sinks in with you tube and Google along with added new features  off old and newAnother annoying thing is it keeps giving the entire description ex  song or any movie  which cannot be put offIts goes not have want I wantIt worked good for about a month But after that it started hanging Now most of the times it doesnt recognise my words and many times it gets hanged while playing music Wipro bulb camed with it also has the same situation I keep its switch on but Alexa says that bulb is offline Total waste of moneyPros1 Sound quality considering its compact design2 Compact Box is also pretty small hence good to carry even when you travel3 Great features with lot of additional apps or featured addons4 Does pick up most of the commands very easilyCons1 Intial connectivity took lot of trail Even though the internet is very fastTipsPlace it on a wooden table for better bass deliveryI did a lot of research and after much deliberation I finally decided to go with Echo dot Gen 3 over Google Nest I have to say I am totally loving this I have connected it to my Smart TV Fire TV Wipro Bulbs Camera and Smart Sockets Overall I am satisfied and the device is working as expected The only minus point is that the power cable is using oldstyle pin connector instead of mini USB which is more a universal standardThis is the second time that I have had to purchase this product my first echo dot device stopped working and since it was not in warranty I was advised by AMAZON to send it to their CTDI team which handles out of warranty devices My experience with CTDI has been nothing short of a nightmare The CTDI team is impossible to contact they do not respond to emails and their phone service does not work After having my device for nearly 5 months  I was sent a redicolous high estimate for repair which costs as much as a  new device itself Not only that  the email coatation is for a fire stick when I sent them an echo dot device Again no clarification received from them till date even though I have sent a second reminderMy reason to go into such details is that one should never waste ones time with CTDI and what is even more shocking is AMAZONS attitude once your device is out of warrantyAMAZON arrogantly washes their hands of you and your problem My Nephew is in love with it At first he was surprised how it could answer all his never ending questions Now he is so attached with it and guess what we are also relieved now we dont get so bugged by his all sorts of questions now Some we knew some we had to research Now he can himself find out his answers and use it as a PDA for himselfUpdateI ordered second one for my another nephews bday Its great product to introduce technology to the kidsThe product is really good and works fine as per the expectationThough the proble is once it gets hardware proble as in my case due to fluctuation in power speaker of my device got damaged Then I had sent it for repair but in india they cant open the device and repair it hece I was offered to buy refurbished decice at 2000 with just 3 months warranty hence it is like almost paying for a new device with just 3 month of warranty rather than 12 months Again once 3 month is over for the refurbished device you are on your own if device gets any fault Hence the vecious cycle of buying refurbished item or new device will continue as there is no option to repair in India  Hence over dependency on this item will invite this unavoidable vecious circleThis is a good device or should I say a Toy It works exactly as promised So no complaints over thereBUTThis is more like a toy to me The day when I bought this I was very excited to use it but eventually my interest faded and now it is just lying around the house I use it some times to listen to music nothing more because kab tak aap use weather ya news puchoge ya bate karoge I even have a fire TV stick to pair it with and use voice commands but it is not perfect search so I end up using remote I even have a wipro smart bulb but the story remians the sameYOU WILL EVENTUALLY 1 WEEK IN MY CASE GET BORED WITH THIS TOYThis is able to recognize Indian accent really well and the drop in function is helpful for calling the device to talk to the person near the device  The smart plug can be scheduled and works seamlessly Cons would be the sound is kindLoud but lacks clarity The mid frequency needs to be tweeked for optimum clarity and rarely the device doesnt respond when we call AlexaI love my echo dot device There some things which are really good like whisper command I am using google mini for last 1 year it is also really good but some diff are really noteworthy I am living in hostel so I don’t want to disturb my neighbour student in night when I command my echo which is far from my bed to switch off my light In google I have to shout not loud but still enough in echo I can just whisper and it responds every single time  The second thing is during switching off or switching on the light   google repeat the full name of my light for example it shouts ” switching on Nikhil Syska bulb” during night if you have forgotten to lower the volume suddenly you will call google “ switch of the light “ it will shout back “ switching off Nikhil Syska bulb “ but echo dot just say “ok” which way more convenientThough when it comes to connecting to laptop automatically the scenario is totally opposite  google connects silently just making a ping sound and echo repeats my lappy nameThe other thing is buttons in place of touch  I like buttons in place of touch  which make its tough to pick the google  most of the time either it play pause the songs or increase  decrease the volume  If I have voice assistance why would I need touch 🙄Alexa integration because I use amazon shoping and I have kindle  the integration is very much useful for me  My echo reads my book for me  It remind me if my order is coming todayPortability  it’s shape makes it less beautiful but good in portability It fits in my bag so conveniently  just ignore the dangling cableI just dont want to integrate it with anything in my house as it doesnt sound clear via built in speaker and 35mm output jack I brought it for listening music podcast and GK but due to poor audio clarity it is still not in plugged in state in my home it is just sitting on table without its adapter plugged inI ordered this product because it shows in web description as Echo Dot 3rd GenBut when I connected to it with my alexa app it shows Echo Dot 2nd Gen instead of 3rd GenI am feeling like cheatedDatabase need to update sometimes gives wrong answers sometimes unable to understand the question and start giving different subjects description I would like to suggest Amazon to update the Database urgently one more thing the microfone is getting weaker than when i purchasedWnna buy only smart speakergoogleWnna get an amazon atmosphereprimeamazon musicfire tv etcalexaFor a smart speaker its not that smart nothing works without activating a skill and skills set trust me not that great sukhaa pada h yaar if you only want a smart speaker 🔊 and you are heavily invested in amazon prime and fire tv stick like gadgets and you have other smart compatible devices and you need the help of amazon services very often only then go for it Until used with amazon family its good but if you want only a smart speaker then go for google home mini nest version you will be very happy Alexa is just a very weak ai in front of googleMy son has been asking for a long time However we werent buying This time we decided to buy Its an awesome product we are astonished by its voice recognition capabilty Its picks up right songs with minimal inputsWe have integrated it with fire stick alsoNo regretsI recommend a buy Happy Alexaing I truly don’t see the point behind Alexa or any smart speaker for that matterI finally bought it coz it was on offer during sale and I just wanted to see what the fuss was about and I was right there’s nothing great about a smart speakerThere’s nothing much you can do with it and the charm  novelty wears off quite soon More of a gimmick than an actually useful gadgetDon’t get me wrong the product is good but I really don’t see its utility Buy with your own wisdom  utilityVary good 😃 but volume not loudSound quality is very good  but  volume level is not goodThe word had to be moreখুব ভালো 😃

recognise and Even I changed default music to amazon music app when I ask Alexa play music from amazon music its not recognizing tried multiple times its not working can help meWorst software desinged sont blame customers just providing like switch off lightsand ola bokkingetc because whatever we spoken alexa is not listen even it contains builtin jio songs Lets say examples alexa play  palasa 1978 movie telugu songsbut default its going default liat songs are playing from jio saavan insyead of what i given command And even we created playlist from differeny music appsjio saavanspotify but its not recognizing with Ads you are providing whoever developed does they using this They know the faultsrigorously test softwarePlease improve this more and more featureA great device to have makes your life easier combined with other smart devices it makes your home a smart homeComing to the productBuild quality is very good looks great anti slip base keeps it in place sound is also crisp clear sufficient base and enough volumeConnectivity is also goodCons needs constant power supply would have been better if it had battery backupSuggestion to amazonIf it could be used as bluetooth speakerI got the echo dot on offer and excited to use but voice recognition is not working tried to restart and done troubleshooting steps but no use Placed for replacement lets see what happensThe main feature of the app echo dot is alexa but for me that is not woorkingFirst thing i am very happy with amazon deliverythe product is at my hand before 24hrs after I ordered even I am not prime member it was very good and super fast delivery compare than any othersHere my review after using it 1 weekEcho dot alexa  the product is in good conditionfeatures are very smart you can play variety of any music which are in your mind alexa can tell you whether info news reminder alarm on single statement spoken by you feel smartness while talking to alexa My 3 yr son also like it while speaking with Alexa he ask to play songs which he likes most overall i am very happy with this productVery useful one Luckily no Ads disturbs the StotraluMantraluSongs so can enjoy uninterruptedly Audio Quality need to Improve of course in  Hugh volume it may OK but we may not enjoy  the High Volume Fir the sack of quality More functions surprises us Thank to the invented teamI m sorry to say that I was disappointed with this product I know alexa is v popular with ppl who want to listen to songs I wanted to listen to kirtan only but cudnt listen It always played something different Moreover it was not linked to YouTube Had no option but to return the sameCommon guys you need to fix the amazon music search results I search for a song and it gives me a different results and I cant find the original song until I specifically mention the singer Its very annoying when YouTube music works flawless sadly there is no intercompatibility with each otherAlso why cant I change the voice it sounds so robotic make a better alternative its one thing thats keeping me away from making it my default voice assistantEverything else is just great Sound has much more depth Google home mini is tuned for better vocal response while echo is for musicNot sure if it is my device or a general issue but the speech recognition is not up to the mark The device doesnt respond to my devices Wake up text and I need to shout at the top of my voice to make it react Not coolI order this product and the seller was Cloutrail when I opened the sealed box from amazon it was ok however the echo dot product box was double sealed1The actual horizontal seal was opened before and then the seller had sealed it with normal cellotape as mentioned in the pic above2The manuals inside was not place properly inside the box as I am 100 per sure this has been opened and used by seller3 The charging cable of the adapter was in tangled state and the binding rubber of the wire was not even inside the box3 The plastic seal was not present in the device on the top of interface4 Even while setting up I had to reset it to complete the installationWhy did you sent a refurbished product when I ordered for a new oneI will make sure Amazon pays for thisI have never seen such a dumb device in my life I remember the small piano or such devices our parents used to give us when we were 6 years old Whatever you ask it has only few stereotype answers Playing a desired song is the most irritating part It never knows what you want to play instead it plays some fixed song list no matter what you asked her play Also it also doesnt have songs with filters such as genere mood etc My opinion  DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY your mobile is far useful to do things you expect Alexa can The reason for 3 start review is it cant answer simple questions that Google can answer When theres music playing I need to shout loud to tell it to pause Sound Quality is decent but the microphone seems bad Was happy with home automation commandsBut felt absolutely disappointed with the answersSuperb purchase made during the Great Indian Festival Sale by Amazon I feel so good that I made a right decision of buying this wonderful product by Amazon Its a small speaker but the sound is enough for a medium to large sized room It connects with my home Wifi seamlesslyThis smart speaker supports voice recognition and it can recognise my voice which is truly amazingSound quality is very good and it has a nice clear sound which is loud enoughAlexa integration is the main feature of this product which is why its a mustbuy for every smarthomeThe speaker connects to all my smart devices namely Amazon Fire Stick Wipro Smart Bulb Wipro Smart Batten and Wipro Smarthome It makes my life so easyAlexa has a lot many supported apps and the number is increasing everyday You get a lot of interesting apps to use with Alexa For example you can order Uber cabs ask time play a game listen to music and what not This speaker truly leverages the power of Amazon AlexaRecieved the product in less then 24 hours from amazon with price of 2399 rs I can say that its better then gen4 I have setup the device in my hall And the sound it produces is immersive Alexa integration is superb as well as voice recognition Setup process is very simple I also got amazon power plug and havels wifi bulb I paired all three device in 2 minutes And then it is ready to go I can say that one should give it a try to have the experience of technology Completely satisfied 🙂Interaction with Alexa quaility is very W roustAlexa software is very badNo Use compared to Google VoiceCompared to Phone Google Voice is better response and good resultAlexa not matured No knowledge upgraded compared to google voiceAlexa Device is No Use compared to google voice in PhoneMico is not good qualityDifferent answers for simple questions from AlexaAlexa replay is not goodThis device not good for playing for few days Fully boring with alexa replayWaste of MoneyWe have to wait for New latest generation software for alexa until its waste of productPros1 It explains Vocabulary2 for English and Hindi Songs  that only specific to jio saavan or amazon music  Cons1 It cannot recognize voice with low volume from a distance more than a 15 m2 It cannot Understand and Play many Telugu songs It only suggests songs which are available on the music app which you have kept default or amazon music3Bluetooth connection with the device very difficult to set up if you have not used it for a while4 Changing a Wifi Network takes a lot of time Every time u need to enter set up mode  Orange Color light with pressing dot button  It is better if we can directly change from appOverall I think this was super value for money I havent used any other smart speaker before but I am very happy with my purchase Below are some observations 1 Initially it feels a bit weird talking to a speaker but you get used to it in no time2 The sound quality is pretty good You get good depth of sound with decent bass3 Several skills available and you will definitely find some very useful For example adding stuff to shopping list or setting up a reminder4 Understands the Indian accent very well Sometimes I am amazed by how well it picks up stuff6 Kids love it An added advantage is that they can take help for homework and talking to alexa also motivates them to talk in English7 Now Amit ji voice on alexa but Alexa sweet enough to entertain youBest home usable device for entertainment If you are thinking to buy it or not then Im sure that you will get thrill and enjoy after buying it I was also thinking same but then I bought it for Rs3000 during discount period So wait and buy it when it goes to price of Rs3000 or belowCurrently it is Rs 3500 but wait and Im sure that it will go down to Rs3000 within a 1 or 15 month Just wait and check regularly the price of this product check daily atleast onceIf you thinking to buy google home mini then dont buy at all Ive experienced both Echo dot is thousand times better that it Google home mini dont recogine your voice well and cant perform ecommercial and play games activitiesI was thinking of buying this echo dot for a very long tym  one day i got a 1000 rs cashback in my amazon pay balance reason is still i dont know😹So i brought this echo dot for a net amt of 1499  it was a super cool offerConnectivity was suprr quick  i connected all my bedroom appliances with alexaRoutines setup was super fun ⚡️⚡️she plays my fav soundtracks  she sings for me  say hi to my friends  sets alarm for me  and there is a lot lot things that she doesPacking was super   delvry boy was very coolI am enjoying alexas company very well  thankyou amazon for d productEverything looks goodsound quality and responsiveness to commands are perfectOnly negative is its a plug n play device in that price they should have provided battery in it and then we can carry everywhere we want with us and use it as a absolute bluetooth smart devicethats why im giving 4 star ratingwhenver power is off or the supply stopped by turning the switch off by someone u need to setup again for alexa dot to work its such a hectic and irritating process and once it setup you cant move this device to someother place without turning the power supply off and need to reconnect the deviceI had Google donut but it failed miserably Echo dot is much better however it doesnt recognize some questions But nevertheless good device But the smart bulb I got with it is very very tough to adjust with it through app still havent been able to do it as the bulb instructions arent veryclearI am not criticizing this product but I hope it helps to improve the quality in futureThe speaker quality is very good I will give 6 star out of 5 starsbut the question understanding ability is very very very worst if any question asked it gives irrelevant answersIt answers only for simple qustions like whats time whats my name like that 🤦If I want to play desired songs in local language I has to tell alexa for atleast 5 to 10 times to understand to get exact song 🤦🤦But I am not returning this product back because I like the audio output sound very muchI have both Google Home and AlexaAlexa works better with smart devices It responds much quicker to requests on turning light onoff compared to GHome which clearly lagsHowever Alexa lags GHome on answering questions and playing music When asked to play music it frequently responds with Saavn is not available in your region while playing Saavn other times Also its response to natural language questions is behind GHomeSpeaker quality great Speaker sensitivity excellentit catches the wake word even when spoken from a distance GHome lags hereLikeProduct is good Integration with Amazon music is goodDislikeNo battery back up So it occupies the power point Not portable as well Major disadvantage for the price paid The same size of branded wireless speakers are far cheaperA must have product in your room It does understand English and Hindi questions and queries better than Google Home and also the sound quality is excellent when compared Bluetooth feature comes very handy and notification lightblinking is also a great way Better build quality than the previous generations Featured skills are also available on the Alexa app including the Alexacalling and broadcasting features Mic is also very responsive too Bass of the speaker is sufficient for a mediumsized room Only issue is that with the manual buttons on the top which for my taste looks very ugly Although if looks are not the priority then it is THE BEST buy in the smartspeaker segment todayAlexa doesnt understand the commands properlyI ask to Play Sainyoo Nee it Plays Sainya VeI ask to Play It plays some other languages radio station which we dont understandIt is not able to recognise the Wipro BulbI am fed up with Alexa I want to return it back If PossibleProduct is good after using for a month felt bad I should have gone to 4th generation few features are missing in it just a suggestion should have added micro sd features too to listen for some downloaded songs also All features are good and working well HAPPY WITH THE PRODUCTI didnt like the sound signature I had to reduce the Bass to 0 and mid and treble to 10 to make it suit my ears The Alexa app is very sluggish Its very well built can recognise voice from distance options are less as compared to google assistantBest Smart Speaker I have bought  Got it a very good price during Amazon Great Indian Festival got it for around Rs 2200 along with Smart Led BuldPros 1 Very Good build quality2 Superb Design3 Amazing Audio Quality4 Very good audio songs collection5 Helps is various smart task like controlling smart lights at homeCons 1 Not portable like a Bluetooth speaker as it requires power and internetOverall I am very satisfied with this product I can recommend this if you are someone looking for a smart speaker with good sound qualityPlease note you will enjoy this device only when you will be prime member of Amazon 1000 kyearOtherwise its very bad after few days Initially you will enjoy voice command but its not accurate and limited So you will want to control it from mobile But its only possible to prime membersWorst ever delivery experiance from amazonyour otp based delivery is the worst thing Getting frustrated by waiting for otp after deliveryespecially at times of mobile network failuresno msg came for otp no option to re send the otp no instant customer care number to contact user enemy application if your algorithm fails to satisfy our customer needs give us an alternate to reach your customer care  here after i wont use amazon for purchasing any thing give us alernative if your algorithm fails  dont make us fools  by your algorithm  rules one star for makes us frustrated by your delivery rulesIts quite a simple yet powerful device While the voice recognition system still needs to improve The range of microphones is wide and it wakes up on calling instantly most of the time The speaker quality is good and pairing two of the for a stereo configuration will make it much better Alexa works well as advertised and with additional skills it can become better Would love to see more regional language officially supported as its right now restricted to Hindi onlyIts not good as i thought about itEven its not working according to my expectationsWhenever i ask or ordered somethingAlexa didnt perform its 100 even its doesnt know some common locations or alexa doesnt know about very common songs singer n albums its totally worthless in this task nd this is the biggest issues i faced with alexa and the last thing is alexa doesnt satisfied my expectations 😑😐So its totally up to you guys either you improved its skills or take my suggestionqueries nd issues lightlyIt depends on you guysyou take this note as my humble request or a joke but seriously its not a joke 😇😇I am Your one of the well wisher not a judge 😊Pros1 Sound Quality Superb2 device looks great stylish3 Alexa is too good only in those things which are shown in TV ad Dim the light play animal sound so on But world does not end hereCons1 Integration with other device poor and take lot of time Software and app working is poor2 Voice recognition  Extremely poor especially when volume is above 5 Sometime I have scream You feel like better Google kar leta kaha Alexa ko bola diya 😀3 Music  When you say play 90s songs it starts with same set and sequence of songs Boring4 Every time we have keep for charging5 After Wipro smart bulb price deduction effectively Alexa cost me 1700 but wont feel worth As a speaker only yes it isAt last Good affords by Amazon but long way to goI purchased Amazon Alexa 3rd Generation in November 2020 Since April 2021 whenever I connect my phone through Bluetooth and play something on it through my phone the sound that comes from it is distortedAnd then I asked for help from amazon They told me to purchase the same new device since its a COVID pandemic so I agreed and bought a new device and when the device delivered to me after 4 days it was also having the same issue as the previous one so I called in Amazon help services and registered a complaint they told me to pair another mobile through Bluetooth so I paired during the phone call to Amazon helpline and played something on it then it was working perfectly alright but when I played through the new paired mobile on next day the sound was distortedI recommend not to buy this deviceExcellent device After Fire TV Stick this is my 2nd Amazon made smart device  it once again surprises me Sound quality is good enough Voice recognition also works great Only drawback is there is no Spotify integration So I have to depend on Amazon MusicJiosaavan which are both crap Except that its a great smart little device through which you can elaborate your smart life quite amazinglySuperb product Easy to setup and so convenient to use Ive set it up to link to my Spotify account so you get even a larger database if music with Prime music and Spotify combinedThe sound quality surprised me I have many other portable speakers but this one is one of the better onesGO FOR ITI bought this in offer in 2290 I liked the product as the speaker quality is good for a bedroom size The voice recognition is good Overall the Alexa works fine but of course there are flaws in understanding of instructions by Alexa because artificial intelligence is still just the tip of the iceberg I dont think it would have been a good buy if bought above this priceWe have been using Echo dot for playing Music with Kids around It becomes easier to play songs without have to look out for the Phone So less screen time in front of Kids and more family timeSpeaker volume is good for hall Good for inhouse gettogetherI have been using it for almost 5 months and till now I dont have any problem with itIt recognises most of the commands give to it It surfs information from Google to give accurate answersI liked that its speakers are very loud and clear sound qualityWorks excellent for both Hindi and English commandsNot much difference between echo dot 3rd generation and 4th generationAlexa needs some real upgrade in general As for the Echo Dot 3rd Gen VERY POOR Voice Recognition I literally have to yell for Alexa to listen Be it cranking the volume changing tracks or anything whatsoever Had quite some expectations since I proudly own a fire stick Even after buying the speaker which I bought mainly for the purpose so that all my favorite music could come in handy I still prefer to play music on my TV than on my speaker I mean why buy a speaker if you cant even play music on it without a fuss Overall its a big NO HIGHLY DISAPPOINTEDI bought echo dot 3rd gen and was so happy with it that I bought echo input s week after The ease of using without the phone or laptop is great The sound is good enough Obviously it cannot compare with big standalone speaker I have connected the dot to my big speakers and using input in any room I want because it is portableWhen we cast amazon music with exhi it recognises only straight forward songs No podcast or stations are played in echo And it even does not recognise podcast through voice The alexa app is also too slow  Better to go for googleHi guys if u have WiFi in your house only than Buy it or else U need to use your phones hotspot and connect  And one More thing is u need to plug it everytime u cant take it and roam lik other Bluetooth Speakers These are cons of this I hope Amazon bring solution for This  rest everything is fineHave issues of unresponsive behaviour rarely  and needs a restart for immediate use or had to wait few minutes mine works 247 so may be thats an issue This is my second Echo and its worth using at home if you have smart switches installedI was using google all along Bought alexa for a variant 3rd gen is good Bass and treble are very nice in that product range Overall loved the product Got the product after one week of struggle and follow up with amazon A very bitter experience in the last 8 years of mydealing with AmazonEcho dot  this is awesome Very happy 😊1 Its speaking2 Its very kind3 Telling information and whats today weatherAlso my daughter love alexa because it speaks 👌And it plays music and indian songs 😊We are very glad that it speaks and moreThanks to amazon 👌Alexa is great For a bedroom or a living room Alexa works like magic I also got a light Wifi enabled from wipro along with Alexa as a package and it had works wonder for usIt understands Hindi English and also talks with us when we are alone or lonelyYou can also connect Alexa with your mobile using it as a Bluetooth speaker Its a true fact that this version has to be plugged in all the time but apart from this its just GREAT I loved it and a true fan of ALEXAU can better buy some 500 speaker Bcuz Im using kdm speaker Its wireless bluetooth speaker pendrive  memory card can b used If we put charge for 68hrs fully thru our mobile bluetooth we can check charge percentage  it can b play for 3hrs more For setting alarm r schedule program songs etc Alexa not required Alexa is totally waste cant use without power sngs restricted only with prime n fewWorks great Though it doesnt make anything significantly easier its a nice addition to ones room and also a good starting point to experience the futureAudible Suno is a superb bonus to this product And also most used music services like gaana and jio saavn are free to use which makes this very useful Last bust not the least it can easily revive the dying interest in you about the radio channelsBut also be aware that you are signing up for some sort of compromise in your data privacyAlexa is ok nice speaker n mic  But not recommending for itAmazon executive contacted me and helped with steps of connecting wipro garnet Appreciated for taking concern of customer and about how to use Alexa Thank you AmazonI bought first Alexa 3500 work preety well but after few days I saw same item in amazon from same seller cloud tail in 2399 why there is big price difference That mean this product doesnt value 3500So stop fooling customerThe media could not be loaded\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0Thanks to Amazon for this amazing product at an amazing Price in this Great Indian Festival I was lucky to get this Echo Dot bundled with Wipro smart bulb 1999 Now the important thing  How to be able to use it in Hindi  First go and check the software version of ur echo dot from ur Alexa App in the smartphone  go to the Device menu at the down right corner in the app  I have uploaded the pic of the updated software version till today 07102019 Just command echo dot  check for software updates  Echo dot will start updating ur software for a little timeWait until a blue ring appears in ur echo dot Dont prompt anything to the echo device during the updateAfter the update u can set the device language to Hindi India in ur device settingsI have uploaded a small video to show that it is really working smoothlyHope this review will be helpful to people who wants to use it in Hindi like meShes family member now Great way to keep kids talking to her and yet away from sceen being working parents we dont get much time to keep talking to kids but now they have someone to answer all the time I now  never forget taking calcium after setting reminder Worth buyingHiI dont know where to start Since day 1 there is issue in configuring wifi The steps not helping Alexa support is horrible Seems they dont care I dont know what to do with this alexa Use as a 2300 INR speaker Song selection can be based on language and application preferred When say intend to hear a Tamil song like Play Muthu movie songs it plays muthu Telugu songs Mostly not play from Amazon musicso it is difficult to play our selectionwhen I say retro from 80s Tamil songs it plays very old songs from 60s as alternativelyI bought the black onethe speaker outer looks dusty not as fresh peaceJust love it  awesom product awesom integration with all products must buy if you love automation using since last 1 week and I would say may b i should buy it long backmakes life so easy I am amazed with Alexashe can do anything and everything as per instructionmore important she is listneing and follow your order perfectly  Alexa is the only one who is listening me and do what I want  better than my wife Bought it during Diwali Sale for Rs 2449 and Wipro Smart Bulb for Rs 99 And to be honest it is an amazing device which makes ur life easyThough Google Home gives satisfactory answers than Echo Dot for the questions  which are asked but the Sound Quality that Echo Dot offers is just AMAZINGIf u are confused about which one to buy ie Google Home Mini or Echo Dot then I would suggest for Echo dot because of its overall performanceAnd coming to the Smart Bulb I would say that it is kinda a good product which u can get at a low priceAre you a lonely person Do you need someone to talk to If yes go for it If not DONT BUY IT Unless you want to be like Alexa Play this song and want to hear Sorry infinite number of times Please buy any other cheap bluetooth speaker because she wont get connected unless you have a wifi and plus even with wifi she is not worth itNot at all worthy Wastage of money Performance is not good And Amazon is not cooperating for return I got the exchange product today but as usual the set up button is so uncomfortable and its painful to press it for a longer time And the sound quality is so pathetic that music doesnt seems to melodies It feels like a non branded local speaker As usual the wrist product from Amazon Really unexpected from a Amazon Very disappointing and Amazon team is not even ready to give my money backIs there a need for a review Echo Dot is smooth in its functioning did not have to train our voice etc it did it auto for all in family Integrating with the smart bulb was so smooth It is worth the money especially if you want to enjoy music and connect up smart devices in your homeAmazon Echo Dot 3rd Gen is the best in terms of hardware Amazing sound quality with proper balance between base mids and treble And yes you can configure too in the Alexa app if you’d likeNext is the build quality It is really good and feels firm Bluetooth and wifi connectivity is awesome Best part is I can connect it to my phone  laptop and use it as an external speakerThe only downside for me is Alexa She needs a lot of improvement in terms of knowledge Basic things are carried out pretty well like reminders alarms music etc however when it comes to answering questions she fails most of the timeTip Keep adding skills in the Alexa app for improvementWaste product as it doesnt come with a baterry so it needs always a plug point to be connected Basically it can be used only in home and not outdoor In todays portable live this is a waste of purchase and doesnt solve any purpose without portabilityIts amazing product my daughter  want alexa and now she is very happy I m rating used after 2 months fabulous  product  i m speechless  must by guys its very helpful and its very funny entertaining  and math solver with funny games And jokes and horror stories  normal stories easy to setup  with different languages And volume is very good low  high and etc must buy and thnx amazon  for this geourgeous  productDevice is very good Sometime they confuse about the similar word like if I ask one song and if that song has same words of some other song then Alexa will play any song Other issue I found that Ji Saavn songs not played on Alexa I dont know the reason In case if we ask to tell story then Alexa says you have nothing in Kindle app Or sometimes ask many things need to be purchased Anyone has faced issues can you tell me solution Atleast i want know how to connect jio saavn songs to AlexaExpected more from this product like we can use at any place if we have internet but it wont work in that way because it doesnt have battery we should plug all the time to socket and also it dont have option to connect different internet connections automaticallyI understood that it will useful for listening music and to ask regular queriesMusic also it will play all the time from our playlistEspecially we have to use this product only at homeSetting up the device is real pain And making any changes to the existing set up is more painful Speaker quality is good Voice assistance works good for music playing but not for any other stuff Google assistance can be betterThis might be helpful for you all So my request is for technical team about this product please do not delete my reviewIt has got really bad software Most of the answers of this alexa would be sorry i dont know that one  i am not sure which is very annoying  you will get to know this by the time google is much much better than alexa Google is google knows every answers of your question Alexa is not that good its good for like tuning light on or off other than that your taking it for knowlegde purpose  its not good Even alexa dont know many of the hit bolleywood song if command it by saying name of the song or artist I think google is doing better job than alexa It has really bad software trust meExcellent product from Amazon Worth money Suitable for those who want to make a smart home of their dream Wake word Alexa is more heard than echo in echo dot So i prefer alexa 3rd gen is far good than the previous gen  Wanna try echo input and echo show also in future All the best for the team behind AI and Smart techItem is goodbut sometimes if the TV is running and there is a disturbance then it will not pick up your voiceAlso the another issue that I found was I am unable to configure it to my Samsung smart TVwhich is one of the major drawbackelse 5 star ratings for rest of the featuresI bought this speaker just to automate a few tasks ended up loving the speaker and alexa so much that im buying another speaker for the other room aswell the footprint of this speaker is small but it has a way stronger speaker with good base for its size i was planning connecting it to a bigger speaker but i ended up not doing that because it really packs a punch in audioThe media could not be loaded\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0The echo dot is an incredibly awesome amazon productTalking about the sound quality the sound quality is beyond expectation for me its crystal clear and quite loud as compared to its size Alexa integration is great it can do things like movie tickets booking can book a cab it can easily be linked to apple music or other streaming services can read news and specially it can understand hindi which is awesome Talking about the 4 mics integrated in the device These mics works just awesome it does not matter how loud the music is or how far you are from alexa in a room all you have to do is say “Alexa” and she activates The best part is it does not matter how much noise in the environment she can hear you Echo dot can be easily linked to other devicesIt also works with almost all the smart home devices smart bulbs hubs microwave etcNote Echo dot requires a highspeed wifi connection more than 20Mbps for better experience It also requires permanent power supply If you need a portable echo dot you can go for the portable one which was launched in December 2019Really love dis product didnt expect this product to be too gud Best thing is the way it communicate in eng and in hindiDe only drwaback i see is not inclusion of spotify in itDe product is really gud go for small speaker as it can easily connect with ur home theatre and gives u de better experience and u can save some bucks 😅Everything is good but sometimes voice recognition doesn’t work while playing it stops in between for no reason and also you cannot link youtube with Alexa which is kind of sad but its ok Overall its a good buy Few flaws here and there but works fineGood one getting more intelligent with every update Can be used as auxiliary speakerGood quality speaker However you have to install the various skills to unlock its true potential skills are free to install I have installed akinator  Alexa guess the person you think and it is a nice time pass Good voice recognitionThe product is great for the price I bought it for 2799 and it works well Sound defection and quality is good too Just the only issue is that sometimes it won’t recognize the commands and it doesn’t have good bass as compared to google home mini But at this price range it is a go goIts a waste guysSettings are very complexCannot able to connect as a Bluetooth speaker to my mobileIf I say Alexa play tollywood songs it plays Bollywood songsNo matter what it wont able to understand your commands in indian accemtsSound quality is very good and 4 inbuilt far field mic s are useless because I will not catch your voice from 2 metre distance alsohave to shout loudEither it understands Hindi or English bases upon settings not bilingualAnyhow I got it for 1657 approxWould prefer Google assistantI have got it replaced but its again not working and now fed up  with its performance I asked amazon to replace it with Eco Dot 4th generation and willing to pay difference but they do not agree and willing to pay difference amount which will occur to get new 3rd generation eco dotAll good experience but the application is confusing and no digital wellbeing or parental control like Google and the voice is not much clearer but bass is very impressiveSome improvements is required that all GoodMost of the times response is Sorry i dont know To play video you need to add akill to play audio you need to add skillto play movies you need to add skill I mean seriously Is Amazon so dumb that they want user to add all those skills manually instead of adding them by defaultIt cannot connect to smart tv poor voice recognition you literally have to shout so that she can here it If you say Alexa play nursery rhymes on Youtube on fire tv it will say I dont know what is YouTube WTH ManThe audio quality is really nice as compared to the size of the speaker mostly used to listen to classic songsSongs are played incorrectly most of the time unless the Alexa is not given specific keywords of the song by checking on GoogleConnecting home devices like lights  TV is only to switch on or off so doesnt make sense to pairAll and all the speaker is not upto the my expectations and Google is way way betterHappy customer Sound quality and voice command is amazingly good But one thing you must ensure that if you need best experience better opt for Amazon Prime subscription first Coz it will sure work with other music apps but you will not get the great collection of Amazon MusicWhat I hate is it skips songs from a playlistI have saved  Sundarkand which has 4 parts in Amazon musicAlexa skips part  2 or 3 and plays the next oneThis has happened 45 timesI have written to alexa help center but no response on thisI have gone back to mobile app Extremely awesome and well integrated device I watched a lot of videos claiming that google home is much better in software and search related tasks But seriously saying you can go for it without a second thought I didnt found any trouble with search related tasks however continued conversation is a bit limited but rest everything is just awesome And a HIGHLIGHTED POINT GOOGLE CANT BEAT THE SKILLS AND EASY OF USE OF ALEXA Alexa comes with thousands of skills and fun games and much morePlaying music knowing about weather or latest news setting reminders etc have never been easier My kid is a big Alexa fan and keeps interacting with the echo dot Clearly its very easy to use Though it was a bit difficult to connect with the OnePlus TV Some basic TV functions can be performed but there is lot more required The next generation devices will probably have more advance featuresEcho was good with superb sound bought along with wipro smart bulb both are working as I expect but echo has to improve skills rather than entertainmentmost of the time i ended with not getting as I want mainly after query echo has to repeat the query and then it follows but no need to repeat the query makes user more comfortableProduct is goodSound quality is soft I bought two and plays it in synchronised That is amazing it feels like just one is played at two different angleAlexa assistance is too good You can read books from kindle You can play books from audible aur suno audible just by audio command Worthy of price but I sti6 suggest to buy in sell you will get good discountIt can control my smart light Read podcasts and play music and generally answers questions Big drawback is it cant control my Mi TV So go for it only if you want to as there is not much practical need for itSimply the worseee device when it comes to connecting to internetin the world where every things seems to pull off  easily with the help of internet trust me instead of making things easier for you alexa devices especially amazon echo dot makes things ostentatiously difficult for you a sheer wastage of time stay away from itIt is very Portable Device we cant take it anywhere with us but the place where we keep it take less space Voice recognition is Better will play a song it recognition the Voice proper Now coming to the Integration or its intelligences or AI it is Good Skills are good there can be More Skill which can make it best like play Music from YouTube this skill must be there Over all my experience is good with AlexaBY THE WAY AMAZON ECHO DOT IS VERY COOL DEVICE I FOUND EVER I LIKED I GOT THIS PRODUCT 3 DAYS BEFORE I ORDERED AT 5

information like Google please I request add this function to alexa make update on alexa app in mobile through you can update the alexa hope you see this and work on thisI was looking for a Bluetooth speaker with a quality speaker My options was a Sony speaker with cost nearly 3500 and EchoAs I was a prime member at great India festival the Echo came for 2000 and u decided to buy it The speaker arrivedOn my opinion1 Sound quality is really mind blowing I was amazed by see the sound quality for this small speaker Really impressive 2 Voice recognition is super due to its 4 microphone3 Allen’s is really friendly and easy to useTo see a detailed review you can check my YouTube channel“ 3 MAC “This product is small cute and beautifulThe LED light very helpful in many way Eg to see the voice

need to buy one 12v adapterSparkel 12V Car Cigarette Lighter Power Connection Cigaret Socket Male Adapterthen fix one DC Plug pin 40 x 17 mm to this usual size DC pin size is 55 x 21 mmAmazon Echo 3rd Gen is really a good personal assistant and its price worthIts features1 Easy to connect from your android phone2 Easy to play songs listen news Headlines weekly news sports news and many more3 Able to answer basics questions easily but sometimes its not able to search on Google and it will then reply by saying  o dont know that4 Good sound quality  really good Bass 5 At the price of 2000 INR  Its a good speaker as comparison to others So dont wait more thinking to buy or not Just order it and enjoy the Amazon Alexa6 One thing should be needed is that its connectivity from Google or any other sear h engine So that it can search over that and can find easly the answer of any question ask by the user7 And also need to improve some security features over securing users data and some sound detection mechanism8 Overall its a good speaker along with a good personal assistantMaybe I was unlucky as Alexa at times didn’t respond to voice commands We have jiofiber at home with speeds upto 150 mbps given the internet speeds Alexa should not have problems with responding to voice commands Returned the product and was disappointed could be one of defective productThe media could not be loaded\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0Most of the time dont understand what song you are requestingmost popular songs cant be playedwhich is very annoying But good for alexa devicesI like the sound clarity with Alexa interaction but Alexa most of the things and questions didnt identify and she is not known about the questions That is the minus point here I saw Google Assistant is better than the Alexa because Google can make the call to your contacts but Alexa is only for those people who installed the Alexa Application on their phoneIt doesnt recognize your voice from a distance when its already playing a song U need to go near always At times we need to keep repeating our commands again and again Else all goodThe media could not be loaded\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0The seller has sent a used product deliberately The seal was temperedThe product has dust flakes on the bodyGets disconnected every time I lift it must be Some problem with the power socketIt in an amazing deviceThe user interface is so extraordinaryAlthough it takes time to understand and respond and only has data according to amazon however it ia fun and interactive even kids love it and it does make works easy if you have alexa enabled device at your placeA must have gadget for your home or workplaceAmazing This product is just amazing You just have to say Alexa no matters how much loud background is it picks up your voice And sound quality of Alexa is the best Even hindi can be used very well It is just like a physically person talking to youI know people make a really productive of use of alexa but it really isnt useful if youre just wanting to get it for entertainment purposes as the speaker quality isnt that great if youre planning to listen to music and it overalls gets booring after a while and would lie unplugged in a corner of a roomMy expectations was very high when I bought Alexa Eco dot speakerWhen I Say play song “gulabi ankhe ho teri Dekhi” it doesn’t understand and plays different songSometimes I have to shout on Alexa while giving the command to Alexa for playing songbcz of software issue it does not listen in a one timeI am really fed up with Alexa speaker and I do not use itAmazon I did not expect from you😡Product is good but the pricing is quite tricky i purchased  3500 for fathers day special offer and the next day you put it up for 2799So fathers day special price was higher than normalVery easy to connect with the phone Easy to useyou can even make calls to connected devices and make announcements which is so cool The plug can be connected to fairy lightUPDATE GOT MY ALEXA REPLACED BY AMAZONMic works fine nowTHE NRW ONE WORKS FINE BUT THE SOUND QUALITY LEAVES ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT Mic isnt proper Please return this productIt feels like there is a problem with my device onlyIt cannot her me at 1st or 2nd time after I speak the wake work multiple times then it hearsThe sound quality is good at low volume but when you increase the volume it get distorted sound gets really hursh Low end gets compressed They need to improve the sound dude surely not for audio enthusiasm but for daily tasks Got it at just 2k including smart LED I think it gets its value Bluetooth connection is poor I dont if i like it or notEcho dot as a device its really good the sound effect is pretty loud more than expected on software side it needs lots of improvement The microphone wont work for calls or meetings so this echo dot device is pretty good for music lovers and smart homes but not for regular use we cant use this device like other Bluetooth devices n one more main issue u cant carry it bcoz it needs to plugged in to worki got echo dot for 1137   added smart bulb to cart which costed  586Total 17241137586Sound quality best in this categorysmart speakersBluetooth connectivity pairing with other Bluetooth speaker needs patience Bcoz most of time it doesnt recognizeAlexa does 90 of the tasks Could be betterIts too good to have it at home kids loving it We just need to add skills and ask related questions I ordered a smart bulb also and adding that skill is just taking a minute and after that just ask Alexa to switch on or off change colorwowamazing Overall its a must buy productReally good product to buythere are pro  cons for everythingso this also has it as you cant use alexa without adapter it needs continuous power supply to be active which I feel bit weird else everything is perfect Amazon is now become synonymous to excellent quality I bought this during great Indian sale and this echo dot 3rd generation is mind blowing Super voice recognition and amazing response as usual Be is product quality or delivery Amazon is excellentThat should be wireless So that it can be easy to carry without a switch Just because of wire its so annoyingIt is useless for without activation you will not to listen the song if you not subscribe after one month You will never to play songs through mobile Bluetooth But I bought it for 2000 rupees in the saleNot one wifi enough for connecting the Alexa but you need connecting mobile through WiFiI own an Echo Plus and now Ive added the Echo Dot to my living room It makes life so much easier since I live in a Bungalow with my family on the ground floor and me on the first Dropping in to say something or have a distant conversation without yelling becomes so much more easier Its a blessingNow having used Amazons Echo products for over 6 months I sincerely feel that its becoming increasingly difficult to survive without it in my daytoday life Awesome product by Amazon Kudos to this phenomenal creationSound Quality is best for its price and can be used as only speaker but thats jut 1000Rs expensive than Mi speakers or even JBL if brand value consideredconnectivity and Voice recognition is worst amongst all even including Google speakers and apple oneseg try Ishare tere by Guru Randhawa on this and some similar type of songs it will either play random songs or just english onesIt is a good product at this price but has major limitation of being wired connection It takes 3040 secs to start again and anything you want to listen you have to add in ur app which is a time consuming activity  But overall i took it for my 2 yr kid to distract him from mobile phones and it is helping me in that 😊😊 he enjoys dance well on the tunes now 👍👍Review after 3 onths useMust have device at homeA nice personal assistant to tell d you and entertain you with automation Nice if you want to develop any habit  it reminds you to follow Scheduled morning om chantings and prayers daytime songs etc so much inbuiltThe far field voice recognition doesnt work very well with this echo device The Echo spot did this job much better Audio quality is not comparable to bluetooth speakers at the same price point however it does one thing and does that well which is Alexa integration Its a joy to have Alexa plan your day and remind you of things that would go on to save your life  Thanks Alexa Not much thanks to the audio quality It doesnt listen maxium times limited to few apps and most time it goeso n to a red mode where it says wifi problem or it cant understand So him many times sin this world I should keep saying alexa alexa It fails to understand commands properly and this setup issue Mmn then to connect to my cel phone Bluetooth was another saga N now again its not connectingI think those who want a good speakers should go for JBL harman or bose or other brands with just manual Bluetooth option and not waste money in thisEverything is great about the productSometimes it doesnt find what it can be Overall it is a great product to keep at homeA big thanks to its Hindi version My mom gets up early in morning and asks it to play Bhajans and it makes the morning more beautiful No battery drainage worries and no worries of typing and finding any particular song on phone Its simple Just askI want to make sure it needs 247 power supply wifi and amazon prime subscriptionJust awesome but one thing is missing that is google skill due to which most of the time it say I dont know in case of searching something difficult thing otherwise other features are greatShe listens to Vishnu Sahasranamam and Suprabhatam everyday While cooking and doing house work she loves that she just has to say Alexa play Vishnu Sahasranamam

every respectAwesome Device1 Amazing Sounds Quality2 Great Performance3 Bluetooth Connectivity Fast4 Thanks a lot Amazon India5 Voice Control100 RecommendedHare KrishnaI have been using Echo Plus 1st Gen since launch and wanted one more so got this one I have Google Home too but it is not as good as Alexa  999  Alexa recognises my speed voice and 100 of my family members to control Smart Lights  Fire Stick and into Planning to get Echo Show as wellOrdered during great indian sale Upon starting  not at all turning on factory reset unresponsive Rereplacement requested will review once i received itThe sound quality is decent not too loud or low The voice recognition ability of this device is 80  Whatever we want to get it hear from this device like any music or song we have to repeat many times to get correct song I think there is need to get improvementIts not good as compared to older versionsI own the first version of it and it was awesome in taking commands and can recognise my voice from far like a charm But this one many a times dont recognise my voice even if i am sitting next to it Not happy This device have other flaws also Like while playing next songit actually doesnt stop the song playing for like 2 secondsInitially I thought it would helpful to control my redmi TV but later I came to know only mi 5x tv will support alexa Even alexa is not finding my tvOther than as AI its too good especially for kidsNice product to have especially when it comes with a deal A good time pass and although it might have many other features I liked it for songs and lighting smart bulbs😜Sound tends to get distorted at max volumeIntegration is easyCan be more user friendly and Hindi commands should be increasedVoice recognition excellentOverall a nice productPurchase if you get a deal😛Previously I posted NA  But now Im editing my comment that is Alexa isvone my best partner when I alone in home Using daily since I got it I love it😍 And one more thing Im using its original voice instead of AmitGShe is best friend for those people who are staying alone or have limited friend circleI have received my alexa today 27 Dec 2021 but I am unable to set my echo dot alexa mobile application I have contacted cust care but they said today is same problem in india wide but I am still confused if the device has malfunction or really the Amazon Alexa app facing the issue I want reply from Amazon thanksYes in just 9 months the speakers are crackling I have placed a complaint and it will be replaced But now I am very doubtful about the quality If it happens again after 89 months there will not be warranty to cover itAnd Alexa App is the worst app on my iPhoneLooks like it is designed by developers with 0 UX knowledge and it is very buggyI have tried both Google and Alexa devices And in my opinion I cannot guarantee the future but till now Amazon smart devices are much better than google in daily life usageI was debating whether to buy the Amazon Echo Dot  I am so glad that I did  My day is now one long musical day  also being connected to most of my equipment is a bonus  ThanksI dislike due to there is no Marathi language so add it marathi also while seeking in Maharashtra so add itGood and help full deviceyou can only connect the internet on useing time and install the Alexa app on your mobileit is a comment base automatically devicesound quality is verry beautifulbut you can not carry for this device because it direct charge not inbuilt batteryprise is standardyou can connect it also blutooth without internet and play all downloaded movies and song in your mobile phoneGiven 4 based in below initial pointsPackage doesnt have air packets where expecting proper packageIt says 4th generation but still not having aux cable  charging optionProsSound clarity really goodgo for it if you are music loverAlmost recognise all voicesMy day start with this device I bought it 3 months agoI really love this productThis product really amazing and the way controls wireless thing surprisingEverything working perfectFew things has to be developedFew old songs won’t be recognised I request please focused on thisMind blowing purchase😀😀😀😀Need to improve n skills I am a music lover from kerala So try to add more tracks from regional languages Otherwise try to link with youtube to get full range of songs from all lqnguagesThe Amazon Echo Dot a good product able to understand most of the voice commands the sound quality is goodBought it during the Amazon saleWas actually looking for a blue tooth speaker when the sale came upand saw the Dot on salepaid 1999 for it Working fine so far The only con is works only when plugged into a power outlet and there is no battery backupVoice recognition is very bad and does not recognise the words for at least 50 of the time Integration is good does not cause any problems while integrating Half of the time very popular songs also are not recognised by Alexa No settings to store the language preferences All the time you have to choose which language you want to hear the songsAbout voice recognition  Alexa integration I would say it is fine but as compared to bose this echo dot lags behind but over all this is not bad at this budget price What One thing I want to point out is it cannot recognise if it is requested to play a particular song or album unlike Amazon music app This lacking has to be resolved So I am giving 4 starI got it during the time of sale I have used google mini after using google I thought to upgrade it and check how is Alexa It is good as well as bad from from google in different term Alexa has better far field recognition but I think in order to save money amazon have made some cut offs  from Alexa 2nd generation It literally understand what we say 6 times out of 10 timesWell its a overall good package for its price rangeSound is awesome 1010Nice speaker Voice recognition is fine It keeps us busysound quality is marvellous Only problem I get that after power failure this device take long time to reconnect with the wifi More over wifi changing process is a bit difficultIt is unable to find things from Google even it cant find songs or stories from Google It only works when i connect it with Spotify aap Then what is the use of this alexa Spotify and other aaps are in my ph then why i need to buy this alexa It never work with Google It never search things by own with the help of Google It needs aap like Spotify and other aapsGood product superficiallly if you expect to work as youtube or google you will be disappointed but yea ask time reminder alarm news few popular songs its okhad it worked as google or youtube man I would have given it a 5 starAlexa Pairs easily acts as a nice bluetooth speaker Sound is awesome specially bass I owe a 2nd gen echo amd take my word 3rd gen echo is n times better than last in sound quality Worthy successorSpecial thanks to Amazon for quick replacement of my echo deviceOnly thorn in the foot is software Sometimes fail to search desired musicPlease dont purchase it shows you are not eligible to purchase amit ji voice due to geographical restrictionsAlexa is one step to get information of whatever you want Its voice recognition is also good can go sometimes confused The problem I have is its not wireless it has to be continously plugged in at a corner Plus there are few features which needs upgradation for eg maths calculation Some math calculations alexa couldnt do Overall satisfied with the productEchod dot is an excellent smart speaker which feels very useful Got it for 2299 with wipro smartbulb in prime day sale and its a good deal Voice recognition is good enough and speaker sound quality is as good as can be expected at this size overall a high quality product from amazonWorked on first day Stopped to work from second day Tried all steps in vain Not satisfied with the product Going to return the productCheated by amazon I had ordered this product on the prime day sale and this is what amazon does for their prime customers I just received a box which was already opened The alexa itself wasnt present inside the box only the charger was there inside Worst service never expected this by amazonPoor finishing of the product Not expected from Amazon Working is normal Not at all satisfied with the finishingthat is reason for 3stars ratingJust a decent piece Not much appreciated What worked perfectly is1 How is weather2 When is sunset3play music  mostly cant understand which music you said and will end up playing some random4 Setup alarmsApart from that you can just use it as a speaker in a corner of your roomPS still few features were quite good but as i said it cant understand commands at first attempt nor the second attempt PNice but not user FriendlyAmazing product in such a price tag I bought this in Prime Day deal so got 2 in 4k I already have an echo device the bigger one and these two were for my parents and inlaws they are super happy and excited Anyone looking to gift something nice to their near one Got for itVery Good Kids in home liked it very much sometimes facing issue in voice recognition if movie name is common word in multiple languages it is mixing the things upClear soundBeautiful replies from AlexaAstonishing microphoneBeautiful ring ligth notificationsControlling smart home immediatelyLove itThe media could not be loaded\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0Good for the price but sometimes while playing the song she doesnt responds me and yes those who think that there will be a Amitabh bacchan voice then the ans is no as you have to buy his voice for 99 rs overall it is a good product and the bulb is also good quality takes up every command😁😁Best 👍💯 AI ever usedSound quality is damn coolI order alexa from my hall to bedroom yet she listen dont judge I have big areaMost favorite part is before ordering it my mom  thought its waste of money and now she talk with her more than she talks with meI ordered alexa in diwali sale I received it along with smart wifi bulb 💡 which makes it more interesting Now I am looking to buy more smart stuff to connect with alexaDont buy this product if you are planning to home theater feeling instead you can go with best soundbar with sound and this product ia simply a Waste of moneyI have been using this product for 3 days now and this is the best smart Bluetooth speaker i have ever come across The only con i and most people would feel that it has to be plugged in all the time for the use probably in the future it will come with a chargable battery Looking forward for thatOverall a decent buybut for full benefits u hv to purchase voice recognised device like fire sticksmart plugs smart lights etc i got ome echo dot 3rd gen n one wipro smart bulb in 2299 n happy wid d product I have been using from a year almost Just amazing for all your day to activities controlling bedroom lights AC Fan to many other appliances Connect to Laptop Mobile and enjoyThis is my second purchaseIt would be great if it can communicate using other Asian and European languagesSometimes when I ask to play music it will start all over from the radio DJ comments And keeps playing the same musicDoesnt know much about books in other language I thought it can help me with my studies of other languages such as German and asked to read me a German book but it doesnt know itWhen it comes to music also it doesnt know any other language music Need improvement in that area as wellThe media could not be loaded\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0Completely original no problem Even if you find any problem in the beginning then you can replace itAlexa hardware is good Alexa heard from far away  sound quality is good light effects are good But search or informational datase is limited when comes to questions or local regional placesHorrible integration with apps It cannot play songs requested Thought some of the songs are available in gaana its always integrating with Amazon music where there are not many songsSound bass is good but it doesnt support YouTube music and support only hungama and savvan music app by which it doesnt play all songs which we want Google home is much better cause it support YouTube music by which we can play any song and play religious shabad bani which we need so I recommend to buy Google homeDont buy this product Totally waste of money It has many glitches It stopped working within 10 days Called to Amazon for replacement but they denied to replaceEvery time i called they gave different opinions They are not on same pageOne of the best product witch can you buy on Amazon The performance of alexa is good But I didnt get access to Amazon prime music dont know why Songs are playing on Hungama it makes me feel like se Hungama product not amazons And sometimes it give you add before playing music Music have to be played on Amazon prime which should be the first priority on this deviceI liked the Product But I realized after using it for a while that when i was using it initially i could see a light on device like blue orange green  in different colors for  alert reminder etc basically would give the status But I am unable to see that now I tried other options in settings through App but no success I called Customer care for replacement they mentioned I already passed the date and Cant do anything about itAnother super productive item from Amazon Alexa I love to use it well connected with all my smart devices like bulbs TV etc Always find some fun while useing it Best sound quality We hope in future it may support Telugu language also waiting for this updateMain Sanjeev Kumar main echo dot third generation  Wipro smart bulb purchase Kiya Hai Amazon Prime dwara 1999 rupees main 29 September ko book kiya tha aur ek October ko morning mein hi Mujhe mil gaya tha iska sound Bada Hi Shandar hai aur Wipro bulb bhi bahut Achcha kam kar raha hai Maine se 5 star rating Di Hai very nice productIt started hanging after 3 to 4 days but i thought it may be network issue but the problem is same and now it needs set up again and again and set up is fail again and again so  i am fed up with this product alexa app is also very slowSo i would nor recommend this productWastage of moneyWorst product ever Bluetooth connectivity very poor Only purchase if you want to know whether condition or any score other than that its literally just waste of moneyAlexa can do just anythingYou can even operate echoeven book a ride with your phone switched off only the WiFi needs to be ononce setup echo is on its ownit does not need a phone  just a WiFi connectionSet reminders many alarms birthday remindersand do everything possible on this device which is just a little larger than a tennis ballNot at all a good software terrible at voice recognition most of the time it will get you frustrated trying to play the music you want it only understands a set of pre configured commands correctly no AI whatsoever even the sound quality is equivalent to a bluetooth speaker one thirds its priceMy previous one had stopped working after 6months They replaced the item immediatelyThe return was done via me buying a new device and then getting refunded for the amountAlexa is good It understands the query well now For conversation mode you need to train AlexaYou can change call sign of Alexa but there are only 4 options available Bought in 2019 for Rs 1650 Now going to buy another on 26072021 for Rs2249So satisfying Packing was good  Product also reach in one piece I think words can not explain the quality of the product but star rating canSuper purchase at affordable price of Rs  1999 bundled with free wipro smart lightFast response  crystal clarity sound innovative control of 3rd party smart appliances  beautifully designedVery much reccomendedVery easy to control musicShe sings at your commandrather plays songs Plays quizzes with youplays radio stations wakes you u with music and much much more  What I dislike about her is her very annoying female Indian accent voice I wish I could set it to British or USA EnglishThe media could not be loaded\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0Its really worth buying I have google home as well so I realised the capabilities of alexa It would definitely recommend to go with alexa if you are planning to buy assistIt has really great fallback prompt if it doesnt recognise what we said it also immediately recognises the smart devices addedI have no words how good this device is Super happy with the deal that Amazon offered during its prime day sale got it at an amazing price along with a 12W smart bulb The sound quality of the speaker is beyond basic and average Trust me no speaker can give you a quality like this one and with the integration of a Smart Assistant in it makes it an icing on the cake Best deal i have got till date Thank you AmazonI find it very handy Very good assistant at home The more I understand Alexa skills the more I find it useful Overall I do not regret my buy Instead of China I wish Amazon makes it in India to make all Indians happyAlexa is going to eat up your brain with its chatty mode nonworking brief mode I tell her to play a song and before i get to enjoy it she states the song title all the singer names can be 23 or 4 and the source amazon music aaple musicor jio saavn Pretty annoying if you ask me Refund initiatedBought this with high hopes that it would be intelligent to automate a lot of things but it isnt really that smart the most we use it for is to play songsThe product is nice but I dont know why the sound seems to be muddy I have listened to another same ECO dot which i had brought from my friend for testing the sound This piece given to me is definitely having some issue with soundI couldnt use it as it was a faulty one and didnt get connected to wifi and I returned and bought a refurbished one which is working fineOverall product is ok ok typeCant respond to many of commands it only response to some predefined commands especially when asked to play songs on itNot upto mark as compared to Google home in case of response and voice detectionBuilt quality and sound quality is better than Google homeSomy 1 month experience says it is not so bad and at the same time not too goodExcellent product with very good voice recognition Sound quality is equally good and sufficient for 2bhk houseThe only con and I think the most important vital thing absent is that it works only when you plug it to power It is not wirelessProbably the next generation should have thisif you love music and spend most of the time making home and importantly in the kitchen with the busy hands to change the music set the timer correct measurements for recipe and so much more it will come handy i mean i love it so much that i want to get more and gift it to everyone i knowExcellent device I found this device is boon for senior citizens like me It is awesome for youth to enjoy unlimited skills routines Its doing wonderful job by voice routines like light operation play music in scheduled time I am very impressed with its remote controlling We can operate lights music with mobile phone appHappy with sound quality Not required amazon prime Im using it free without any subscriptionsFor 1500 sqft home Alexa dot is a perfect device we dont need additional speakersClever answers collection I have attached one smart bulb with this and it is well controlled by AlexaOVERALL VALUE OF MONEY PRODUCT MUCH BETTER THAN GOOGLE MINI Nothing exceptional about it Average sound quality Actually its waste of money Alexa integrates to very limited apps and that too from Amazon only Its made in china and Amazon is intentionally hiding itLovely lovely lovely thank you Amazon for this wonderful product I mainly use this product for testing my own developing alexa skills Anway outstanding product Its always stand one step ahead than Google HomeStopped connecting to WIFi after 2 weeks of use  and not connecting to WIFi at all even other devices are working well with same routerThe sound quality is great but some answers for the question isnt good but in most of the question google smart speaker gives the appropriate answers while Alexa only tells result from the web I would love to have answers like google assistanceif you have more of the echo and amazon products this is gonna rock youll get the best out of itI was excited to get a smart device for the first time But Disappointed I was able to connect first and was exploring things by then had auto disconnect and tried multiple times to connect it was not happening My bad I have to return the product 😢Half the time it doesnt recognise half the time it doesnt have that song to play and it never let me enable follow up mode Google nest mini is much betterMy Alexa echo for is not responding to my voice commandTill setup everything was okBut not responding to any of my voice commandGood productinitially ordered for Rs3499 and on the same day suddenly reduced to 2999 by the same seller Canceleld the first order immediately and ordered for 2999 But today at independence day sale it is just available for 2000 Configuration to our network and setup is tediousbut I managedthe process needs to be even more simpleThe media could not be loaded\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0Sometimes it just freezes And plays something else Google is smarter But the sound of alexa is betterNice product but they have less options in terms of music like devotional and other like you tube Although comparison with youtube is not perfect As youtube plateform is run on users based and collectionIt wont work without power Voice is slow Wifi is compulsory Otherwise Alexa wont work Not at all user friendly Returned itThe media could not be loaded\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0Didnt know why some times its behaving like too noisy and scratching sound happened quite a lot of times since I brought it but restarting it fixes the problem but experience wise I didnt expected this from Amazon products disappointed 😞Things to improve1 Please allow phones to play any music via alexa speaker Atleast add option to Play this song on echo dot to Amazon play2 Add feature to schedule activities Like play this song after 2 minutes or play this song everyday at 5AM Similarly turn on light after 1hour or turn off light after one hourEcho dots across rooms transfoms them to smart roomsWithout Echo in a room its simply inhabitableThe product is good but the main drawback is it doesnt have inbuilt battery and we cannot use this speaker while travellingIf this product has the below feature than i would have given 5 on 51 Battery backup2 Make calls to everyone doesnt matter the other person have Alexa3 Aux connectivityThe product cant do much more than playing songs  it fails to tell distance  meaning  song search is awafull  fail to search article on internet skills dont work  I was very excited to buy alexa after seeing advertisement on internet but I  really very disappointed after receiving itThe voice recognition was excellent as usual like other Alexa devicesthe sound quality is better compared to other portable speakersalthough the setting up process is  bit annoying if we didnt order it from our Amazon accountBut overall still its a excellent oneAlexa does pretty much all the job sound quality is good Microphone is good not the best It does most of the job but it lacs lot of knowledge as it is depended upon Wikipedia if its not mentioned in wikipedia it wont answer IF u ask it How are u it always gives a std reply which is bit irritatingIt most of time blinks orange color to indicate it is waiting for a command word and we arent using it which is a kind of spyingI got this product in offer basis product is good But 2 issues I found one is Alexa is not recognising the voice clearly and second one is she is not playing correctly what we are asking They might be sent me a refurbished item actually before that I dont know reg these issues before I saw my friends AlexaEcho dot Really I am not satisfied on this productProduct is pretty good in other words it is awesome I am using this daily for streaming songs and weather forecast Easy to install and easy access BluetoothEven my kids uses it to access rhymes Thanks to AMAZONBut coming  to delivery it is too bad recently I have ordered two units in which I have received one and other one is not delivered till now customer care says that my products is in damage condition that is the reason it is not deliveredvery unworthy reason from amazon Being a very big reputed company I though of gifting it to my friend on 03Oct2019 as it was his bday but you people have disappointed meIts very helpful for me I have to order sme thing I dont have to use my pn I have to only sayalexa buy that i have to say alexa turn on Wipro bulp i have to sy alexa turn on smart switchThe sound quality is only average but gets the job done Gets pretty loud thoughIf you listen to a lot of music using a Bluetooth speaker or something in that case this becomes a great replacement Smart  convenientWorth a shot for sureI am very happy with this device as it has made my life easier feel good to upgrade The Bluetooth connection is good and the mic is really as mentioned in the product description In short its a must buy device and oh yes I got this device to connect with the TCL 55 P series tv Will connect it and come review againIntegration takes too much time Doesnt understand a lot of stuff and worst part is it needs to be connected all the time Unable to connect to my mi smart android tvToo much time and energy needs to be put in to set it up with anything Not worth itBought This For ₹25k And I Feel Its Good Enough For That Price Though 2 Days Into It And Theres Pretty Much Every Integration You Can Imagine Of This Is Also My First Step Towards Home Automation And Ill Love To Do That In FutureUsing it since Oct 2019 I am happy with the productThere is scope for improvement in voice recognition Some intelligence is required in the product when you ask for regional language musicI bought this device for 2k in prime sell I am quite impressed with itBelow are the pros 1 Easy set up in 5 mins2 Integration with Airtel  Syska Hungama WiproSavan  etc apps was was quite easy  Didnt face single issue3 Sound is crystal clear and pleasing4 Looks amazingAnd many moreCons  I couldnt find anyGreat product and really I didnt expect that small speaker can have such a strong bass and great sound and also loud enough that can be headed from down stare  Really a great oneAmazon should update these devices to enable it to use any open wi fi or hor spot Otherwise you may need a dedicated wifi router or always available mobile phone If both goes down Alexa goes down Why to stick on a network let it use any open wifiLady Alexa is 3rd genno more a kidshe is young cant go blild in a mens world at her prime young agetimeShe should have Four Way eye sight to see and observeAm I right dear I love her very muchI presented Eco Dot to my grand daughters  They are very happy  satisfied with it  They say that it is the best gift since now   Now I am planning to buy for me to listen old  new  songs as well  In Deepawali sale I got this for 2500 ₹ with smart bulb  I am waiting for another sale   Sarita MishraOne of the Best purchases Sound Quality is Superb Inexpensive Alexa remains the best voice ecosystem for smart home control Only con It is not up to google assistant level while answering broad information queriesPortability is poor because it’s a wired device and doesn’t work without the power cord Should have had batteries option too in which case one could call them portable That said all other features are modern and quite useful tooNot that user friendly infact Many times it fails to understand our request and mainly cannot recognize kannada language movie songsBut voice recognition is good and other informations are well casted need more updates and should introduce all regional languages aeapThe media could not be loaded\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0This was launched on 11th and I got the product by 12th Plus the reduced price due to sale and a nice smart bulb for just 500 rupees Overall I think this was super value for money I havent used any other smart speaker before but I am very happy with my purchaseA must buy product but I’ll suggest buying while discount going on because I find it lil expensive but still it worth buying anyway 👍🏻👍🏻 My 6 year kid enjoys talking to alexa  playing songs on on it My whole family loves itThis Alexa echo dot is super smart and it has sophisticated technologyif you have fire tv it is the best you can control the tv with your voice and it recognizes your voice perfetly You can also play so many games with it and it is best for kids You can also buy a smart lights to control it with your voice It almost has every question you ask you can also ask it to say a story or play music and much moreThe media could not be loaded\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0Crisp and clear sound with lots of fun I am loving itA great speaker love the sound And impressive voice recognitionCould do a tad better on the Alexa software as it takes location from the language you set also particular language settings only work with a particular skill Also a youtube cast skill would be greatA great device Not only making my experience of listing to music better but also helping my child in learning English better Also has many skills which are making life easy and helping kid learning and exploring new stuff Also got at an amazing price during the sale Ok oki dint the product much It needs a lot of tuning and improvement in terms of features and intelligence Not a smart device Had a little trouble adding the device to my Amazon account but thats probably because my WiFi was acting up The product itself is great The sound is pretty loud for such a small thing The Alexa integration works fine No complaints so farIts a very nice product I ordered it during the big billion day Sale I got a wipro smart bulb free with it The speaker sound is loud and clear Dont go by its size it produces sound loud enough to fill a small room And the sound is very clear too Alexa feature is also very helpful I have bonded a smart bulb with it which was very to easy to do Just follow the instructions given in the instruction manual that comes with the product and all will be done without a hassle Overall a very nice product Thank u AmazonThe media could not be loaded\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0Nice Products But Not Google Add in Google

months back i purchased it and I didnt found any drawbacks ThanksWhen You have alexa U never Ever feel alone as you can interact with Alexa And do tons of things like Listen to music news weather forecast and many more Alexa hindi Has so many good and very funny responses its kind of becomes your routine to talk to alexa For sound quality i will say Its 455 star as the sound quality is amazing and can fill a room easilyMost of the times it doesnt recognize what u meantplus u need a subscription to use amazon music thankfully I had apple music subscriptionSo first looking at echo dot I thought it would be very small but the size is very good and sound is also very superbJust the AI if you ask some questions it will not answer as crisp and clear which you get in Google otherwise for the entertainment this is the best and connectivity is also very easyAlexa becomes a family member even before you know it The sound quality and ability to integrate with one’s daily life at home is awesome From info on the weather to traffic snarls we’ve come to depend on this bright new companionThe product is very good and compatible with almost anythingi ve connected my bedroom moodlighting wth alexa and i can turn onoff change colorsAnd i can control many other devices and the audio quality i really goodValue for money affordable virtual assistant Crystal clear sound Bass is good Very responsive mic Overall satisfied with the product from AmazonEverything is good but the calling feature is asking to install the Alexa app on other phones too its quite difficult for everyone so we couldnt able to make a call 🤷\\u200d♀️Being a prime member at Amazon is necessary otherwise the product is unable to play music and popular songs The sound quality is ok Some instructions are hard for it to follow Eg Alexa give us an applauseIt plays out nice music but it found it hard to connect smart bulbs  I bought Halonix smart bulb It recognized the bulb but cant control it1 Had to scream or stand very close to it then only it heard the command2 It was playing 2 songs at the same time3 Sound quality was very poorमुझे इतना पसंद नहीं आई अलेक्सा मुझे उतना अच्छा नहीं लगा आप आप सिर्फ इस पर गाना सुन सकते हैं कुछ पूछ सकते हैं इसके अलावा और कुछ नहीं कर सकतेGood quality productGood sound quality Not compared with jbl or sony speakers but better than boatWell its not just a bluetooth speaker its smartAlexa is very interactive it takes a bit time to update skills in alexa and then you can have alot of fun It also has a aux output port you can connect any sound system for better soundPurchased in a loot offer for 1229 Awesome for d price I paid Not worth if yo pay more than one thousand five hundred My kid njoyyinh with it Setup was very very easynjoyyinh with free led bulb Sound quality is averagebt connectivity is good Using it with mobile WiFi working wellCostliest than the quality  can we return it now as due to covid19 Pandemic unable to process return of the device all the packings are kept intact and even plastic over the product kindly advice the procedure to return back nowBought it in prime day saleProsGood sound quality considering sizeHas bluetoothHas aux outGood mics recognises whispers easily and whispers backConsToo small in sizeNot value for moneyNot wirelessNot much smart functionNeeds good wifiHeats upI am totally bored  this device have crappy software and limited number of uses unlike its counterpart google mini I made a terrible mistake buying it I would love to return this if it werent for the return period being overNot worth at all Overall extremely poor performance  after salesIts a very good product but alexa must have some upgraded skills like voice lock and continuous conversation I cant have continued covo with alexa and thats somewhat disappointingI was so confused to buy it or not because there were many negative reviews but i decided to buy echo dot 3 gen This is my first alexa device got delivered today just loving the sound and bass Dont care of negative reviews just buy Its awesomeThis is a really expensive bluetooth speaker that happens to take voice commands to play songs and switch on and off the one smart bulb in my room Thats for me if you have a full home automation setup in your home do buy it it will be a good effective investment for the sameThis not a smart speaker most of time it will say Sorry i dont know that or it will ask to refer amazon page for helpi will suggest Google smart speaker is much better alexa is just seems a scrap and more over alexa is just an amazon shopping tool to listen customers and suggesting them  products to buyGood experienceGood sound qualityu can also operate ur smart gadgets with thiswhen u asked funny question to Alexa in HindiShe replied in a funny waythat was soo interesting about this product andAt night when u talk in wishpershe replied in the same waythat was soo cooli lik this productMust buy itIts always says invalid password while connecting to Android Samsung devices however its works on IOS devices I have shared the screenshot with Amazon team but they barely reply Highly disappointedFabulous product with such an easy of operation that my aged mother uses it seamlessly Easily recognizes hindi language In the morning she just commands it to play live gurbani and later in the day her favourite singers song  No wires no pairing with phones Drop in feature is amazing too It comes in handy at times when the phone is not nearby All in all an amazing product from amazonfollow up mode not workingtried every troubleshootingMay be my product had some bugreturning itfollow up mode is most important feature in Alexa for using on tv or day to day questionsNot always respond to ur voice when u give continuous command one after anotherall other things were working fineDevice recognises the call work but then freezes Does not execute commands given to it Worst purchase everIt plays certain songs again and again doesnt let you skip Recognition has also gone from bad to worst you have to yell for Alexa to understand what you want it to do only for it to tell you it doesnt understand what you said And expect no support from Amazon about eco devices its very badWas skeptical whether to buy it or not But after the purchase feel so happy that I bought it because my daughter loved it a lot She keeps interacting with ALEXA Pluse Alexa makes some of your tasks easy Just go for itAlexa device is good I wont say it is the best sometimes it doesnt recognize the voice overall I would say its value for money as I purchased it for 1999 in offer with that I got a smart blub from wipro free in amazon saleI liked the product very much and it has got great featuresOnly thing it is missing is Auto Audio Control When it play music many songs plays loud while many at low volume Very annoying to ask Alexa to put volume low and high for each songWaste of money Pls do not spend on this Hardly it recognizes the indian music channels artists movies etccan  or connect with your smart phoneit can make calls only between alexa or to skype Cant integrate with indian mobile simI bought it for music making calls etcwaste of moneyThere is this huge interference in 24 GHz band while using Alexa it will screw up yur wifi speed for sure it u are not using a 5ghz wifi band really huge problem which needs to be fixed but sadly even there backend team cant fix the issue and just blatantly as u to use a dual band router and use 5ghz for internetThere are few problem in connectivity but sound quality is excellent if u love listing music echo dot is brilliant Eco dot is a fantastic smart speaker but being a music lover i wanted one thing that is if alexa had a option from which we can create play listIn starting I have find issue that alex didnt able to recognize my voice but after sometime it was fixed Now i am satisfied i get in a fantastic product in great price😍If you are looking for just a assitant its good otherwise if you are using at full time speaker sound wobble at high volumes and sound quality is not good no bass  Or maybe i got a defected pcs dont know but have google nest using from 1year its better anyhow in sound quality then alexaIf you could grab a good deal at sale on Alexa  dont miss out on it Youll love the sound quality as well as other skills that Alexa hasPlease add Sunday Suspense from Radio Mirchi Kolkata or YouTube as skills  Popular Bengali audio stories because my mother is completely blind and Alexa is helping with automation I

of the day it didn’t I am hugely disappointed Will never buy any Amazon product I simply wanted a Bluetooth speaker which is basic functionality of speaker that too not workingProduct is good using it for 15 days nowFlipkart delivery excellentLack of Voice recognition Dont understand lot of thing and dont have answers in lot of timeOnce started answering anything wont stop till it finished and wont repond inbetween if we call alexa several timesGood for kids Playful tooNeed always strong and continue internet data networkLovely one Very glad to have this realy its awesome Only one thing is that i ordered grey and received black Please exchange with grey color Otherwise nice device sound is ok for light music and and party music bit small Thanks amazon love uThe media could not be loaded\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0Alexa is quit irritating because it only understands 80comands but its ok because after all its a robot hope new Updates will make her more and more accurate You should only buy it in sale 2300rs then its only a value for money product in 2300 I got Alexa and a Wipro bulb with it I am happy with the service alsoWe purchased our first Eco Dot from AmazonOur family was very much excited to see how it works But there is lots of issues with it If your connection is lost than it will take lot of time to reconnect we have to switch it off and on Many times for reconnecting  Sound recognition is very very poorMy suggestion is for Amazon sound recognition should be made for Indian accecentAwesome and Music quality very good If you dont have prime membership just set Gaana to your default music service from alexa app to listen music without adsDoesnt pick up command easy when its playing music search results are inaccurate No option of batteryAfter receiving the device had integration issue and later got to know from Amazon team that it was a known issue for them Not sure why they still wanted to send the deviceI am happy to use this Alexa i bought this is offer with a smart bulb Bulb didn’t worked but Alexa rockedThe main disadvantage is its not portable and requires continous power supply and its not mentioned in product description Sound quality is very poor No bass Its just like playing songs in your mobileGood for light speaker use dont expect a boom out of it And yes Alexa is awesome but buy if you have use dont just go with the trendI like this because whatever I tell to Alexa it listen When you have to listen joke tell Alexa open hindi joke When you have to listen song tell Alexa open best BollywoodHollywood song and it will open automatically But when you purchase this product  At first you have to go in playstore and download Alexa app and other thing you have to do and it is necessary also I thanks Amazon for making this type of product  Thanks  From  🇮🇳The media could not be loaded\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0Really this product was amazing my experience very well with the my routine work Alexa remember me Alexa set the alarm in many more works play the songs in enjoy with usImage just for referenceAlexa is best in voice recognition and it says some times sorry mujhe nehi patha which irritates me the answers were simpleAlexa needs more improvements in hindi language and expecting it to be launched in regional languages tooExtreme happy is that I bgot it for just 1314 rupees onlyI know many of you will not believe 😂1 Voice recognition is poor esp with accompanying Wipro smart bulb2 It frequently says that it is not able to connect to internet however it works fine after it is RESET So the problem is not internetIt doesnt have option to add major Indian music apps like Gaana Jio Saavan and Wynk music apps You can only link Amazon music Apple Music and Spotify so its very difficult if you already subscribed in these app This is the major issue otherwise everything is too goodWont connect to the other devices doesnt link to my Amazon music just knows hungama music maybe due to tie up but didnt think I would be using it for music purposes only as its useless in every other sense Its better to have a speaker than an AlexaI bought in Echo dot in sale its working for just one month after till this time its not yet connect with my wifi also its not user friendly Feels like they rid of money its totally wasteWowBought for my family entertainment purpose solved enjoying with the product sound quality satisfied worth to buyVoice recognition is very good  Alexa integration requires future upgrades in its AI capabilities Since only specific phrases  that to in particular order would activate proper correct response Sound quality is fairly good for such a small deviceWho love technology this product is good for them  im happy with this product but it’s more interesting when you by other eco devices with it like WiFi switches WiFi bulbsBeen using this for last 5 daysSetup was a breeze Establishing connections was pretty simplewith minimal effort  connected to my Bose Mini II Build quality is very basic certainly has room for lots of improvement on that frontBass levels are inadequate and hence the need for connecting to slightly  better speaker BoseHowever my need was to get onto the Alexa Ecosystem  so very basic speaker is something i could live withthis product is great sure there are sometimes she cant answer but most of the times she canshe can play music answer alot of questions and if you have smart devices like fire tv then alexa can on them by commandthats why i recommend you to buy itAns for a fixed question onlyunable to give ans for all questionI ask where is chittorgarh fort the ans is i dont knowits not self learning aiProduct done very well for up to on month But when I deregistered for some problemAfter that it is not connecting to jio fi networkplease help meIt doesnt recognise the voice everytime and it makes me repeat multiple times before I get what I asked for Overall sound is nice but sometimes it gets low automatically And for most of the things it has only one answer which is  I dont know I expected much more from it Google works more precise than AlexaThis product is high quality material and high technology Very easy setup for smart home and fire TV stickPoor collection of songsPoorly bifurcates songs as per year playback singerwe had received one earlier and now bought the second one the sound is very good and alexa also responds well one can good net connectivity else it may not workBuild quality and design is goodBut Google services like YouTube cannot be linkedThis is the major drawbackBut AI programming for alexa is highly geniusTotally waste of money product as I received Alexa not recognised my voice properly Always need a wifi connection with excellent network to work Alexa 👎🏻 Not recommend to buy this You can go with Google assistant speaker instead of thisUsing from almost a year now  Perfectly fine in sound quality and voice recognition I recommend this if you love listening music  and to operate smart devices But sadly it doesnt give proper answer if you ask general knowledgeSet it up and started to command Alexa to do my bidding Son and missus also love it The sound quality surprised me coming from a small speaker Tried to connect with a bluetooth speaker but not successful There is a learning curve that must be tackled though  The test drive will go on for some more time But so far so goodI bought this for my small home and it is working very effectively Only thing is that I couldn’t figure out how to connect my Samsung tv with Alexa The sound quality and voice recognition is very goodThis is the third Alexa I have  It’s Mike is very good and the speaker quality is also awesome Definitely worth every rupee Go for itOne of the best gadgets which you should keep at homeAmazin quality and sound performance Easily integration and thanks for a lot of features you can use Good Work Amazon Nice Product I would recommend for this device so you can see how Machine Learning will change our future and this is what we will see in next 5 years every yearInitially difficult to connect it later I ve seen the video from you tube After connection it works good Nice product Dont know about the longterm useIts good product as per the expectation if you are new for this kinda thing but need to improvise on the voice recognition part  Its a catch if you are not good at acsent of the linguistic language hoping to speakAt beginning it was amazing Later Im just using it for music and news nothing elseIts quite handy if you want to know something quicklyThe product is very good But there is not much u can do with it right now Just some news music n light operations tats allSmart homes are a long way to come bySome times need to call the name Alex multiple times as she would not respond Other than that its fine“First impression is last impression” really echo is a best companion of all time  sound really good rich bass treble everything what you need to rock the floorReally appreciate you people work behind of this projectReally amazon cheersGood product bought it during EOSS for around 1999 make sure you buy whenever the product is cheaper than the regular price wait for amazon big sale periodGood one Go for itSound quality is excellent but without internet  it is usless Its not even wireless or battery operated that is one of its main consIts not worth buyingthe device was ok for 1 year then one random day it failed to connect to wifibluetooth talked to customer care they declared it defective warranty expiredAlexa is dumb when compared to Google Home I think I made a mistake by buying this Instead should have gone for other AI assistant available in the marketThe media could not be loaded\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0SuperbWhen the music is playing on the Echo dot it doesnt always pick up the call word Youll have to be either close to it or speak loudly Other than that the product is really good Sound quality is also pretty good Will update this after a month of useHow to detect charging is on or offit is not showing any light while plugin It show only for few seconds then disappearsAint very responsive to the voice commands and the quality of sound reproduction and accoustics is subpar to say the leastWhen i purcahsed Redmi TV i was told that it get connected to Redmi TV but i was unable to connect it when contacted the amazom customer care on how to set this up with they were unable to help me morever they promised a call back which never happenedThe best product Many times I thought that blessed that amazon giving service in our timeamazon Echo Dot 3rd gen is working as expected to the extent now I am thinking why did not I buy the next gen with videoThe sound quality is good however I found 2 cons in this1 You always need to connect speaker with plug else it wont work There is no battery back up2 Alexa would not get everything you say most of the time so you end up choosing to select your song sometime manually rather than giving command to alexaThe new 3rd Generation echo dot is not as good as Amazon claimsI think 2nd generation is better than 3rd generation in almost all aspects mic being the top most You cant use it more than 10 feets away but 2nd generation I am using that 20 feets or moreI need to call alexa atleast 4 times then it will response onceEcho Dot is the best home personal assistant at this price range Alexa listens to whatever you ask her to do and does the task excellently I am highly impressed by this device1 There was an ongoing issue happening with the Wipro smart light not getting paired with the echo device\\u200bHere is the case ID 03036247912 voice Search accuracy is not goodNice product I loved it very much it has made my life happier by listening to various songs and musicEcho Dot recognise your voice well  good at playing music  alarm and reminding important thing to you  Theres a little problem It always in search of songs as i asked For a GK question  Is you are a student and want help in study its not for you then Excellent sound qualityl am enjoying Coudnt expect such wonderful sound from a small device like echo dot 3rd gen I got it in a bundle offer with syska smart bulb That too has delighted meAmazing productProsAmazing voice recognitionGood sound qualityEasy to installConsAmazon needs to improve on Alexa skillsNeed more Alexa skillsConnecting to non amazon products is bit trickyOverall a worthy productTotally unnecessary in life But once you have it it becomes kinda difficult to live without it 😀😀Alexa mostly understands everything but still there are some simple things that she wasnt able to search and get results Like i asked who is General M M Narvane But she wasnt able to tell anything Not even she told anything about current Navy Chief These are some loopholes But other than that i have found her amazing overall on every aspectIt required lots of improvement Like it is not that much features like Google Assistant has Voice recognition issue But not very bad It has lots of good things also like we can use as bluetooth speaker and sound qualityWorst smart speakers in the market  after a few weeks its sound became noisey and distorted  unbearable And they will not even replace it  Please avoid if possibleThe media could not be loaded\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0The echo dot i recieved doesnt deserve a single star I am trying to turn on but its not working Wosrt experience and destroyed the expectationsPlease Always test the product at lab or somewhere before making deal with customerI would not recommend it Ordered it and its been almost 1 month now It doesnt detect even if you call it multiple times Doesnt understand basic commands like pause stop Doesnt respondVery disappointed hope had ordered Google Mini insteadGood productI dont think it takes music and other stuff from google or youtubeMost of the music is from hungama music or jio savanVoice recognition is averageAlso tells us the weathertemperatureair quality and also sets alarms and stuffWe can play a bunch of games tooI like it as my first smart speakerAmazing echo dot However the size is not as expected to be as in pictures Its pretty small as compared what we see on the site Its quite small optical illusion i guesshehe having said that i am still satisfied with it Alexa echo is value for money my lo 36yrs can use it too he asks to sing out nursery rhymes and stories and its a hit 99Product is Good but no bettery and no internet then dummyALEXA INPUT IS BETTER THEN THIS ONEWe have setup multiple echo devices and speaker 3rd Gen is little bit let in terms of recognising your voice from a distance Overall goodVoice recognition was too bad Totally disappointed with the product voice recognition Definitely Amazon should improve their voice recognition softwareLoving it 😍 but a disadvantage is that it does not play songs from youtube must add on this feature nd i wanted to but alexa with built in battery but unfortunately when i made plan to buy eco dot amazon havent launched in built battery version must  go for tht guysGot Alexa 3rd gen free with purchase of OnePlus 50inch tv last week it is simply awesome my 4 yrs old kid loves n commands Alexa to play songs and it recognises his wordsTo my surprise  the sound is actually great Alexa recognizes my voice from afar and syncs information correctly Overall great experienceReally worth buying Alexa for smart clearly understands everything what you need and sound quality is superbAmazon alexa echo dot works fine and it hears me when I speak effortlessly and responds Honestly I dont know what to do with alexa just I purchased out of excitement and to experience itAfter using for few days I am totally impressedEasy to set upI am using Alexa for the first time and it is very interesting to learn how Alexa worksSetup process is very complicated and its not getting completed   nor playing anything in speakers only amzone Alexa app is working network disconnecting by its own Very disappointed  m gonna return this very soonUse less product instead buy Bluetooth speakersDifficult to connect if you dont have proper 50 mbps wifi broadband Also it fails to recognize voice while the network flips Moreover the product is average but needs a lot of improvementI liked the productits greatnd sound quality is quite goodThe only fault I discovered is the recognition of voice actually Alexa is unable to recognise voice fasteither it takes a lot of tym or sometimes it just dont even play the required stuffnd i thnk the system is quite complex😅bt then its in my casethe manual will help u quitewell beginner will find it difficult to operate at first bt then u will get used toWhat a solid piece of plastic Good sounding speaker with a color bulb under 2000 was such a good dealSound quality is quite good Can rock a room single handedly Voice recognition somewhat okeish Alexa works like a charm thoughSet up was easyInbuilt speaker is excellent sound quality is very niceBluetooth connectivity is also excellentVoice recognition and understanding is really goodOverall Amazon Alexa is excellentThe media could not be loaded\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0Product is awesome but it should have also supported youtubeAlexa user interface is nice we get most of the information with one voice command Music options are very less they should have interface with youtube songs Ganna app etcExpected more than just onoff this and that  Cant even turn a light on at a specific time by voice command while phones built in google assistant can do thatBest experience with alexaAwesome sounds qualityBest integrationButNo battery storage facilitiesWhen i off Internet this thing not integrate anything  like time bluetooth connectionAlarm If It may possible  we can get better experienceBut the working is goodBuild qulity is awesomeCommanding goodTotaly good experienceGreat product all function work fine easy installation and sound quality and Amazon delivery and support too goodId not choose this item bcoz it lacks basic things nor does it assist u as desieredA nice product especially when you get it for the deal i got I bought it for just 2299 with smart bulb So overall satisfied worth what i gotI overall liked the product it was exactly as i was hoping for and the might facinates so much and make it different from others its worth the price The sound is very clear and soothing and alexa is good in answering just not do voice recognition for one person so it will listen to everyone and its connectivity is good too if you see a yellow light blinking then that is a notification light you can turn it off through your deviceIts like a person in our houseiam happy that I got Alexatq Amazon for the offers and suggestionsThe media could not be loaded\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0Bought for my kido  he loved it best thing for gifting thanku AmazonGood sound quality i have Google Nest hub also Alexa not more than smart than GoogleAmzon gave combo offer for echo dot and smart bulbfor 1999but Amazon cancelled the echo andthet only  send the wipro smart bulbfor 900rsbalance 1073 rs will credited with 3 working days i dont know worst selling concept to sell the productThe product looks sturdy but it irretates when it cant understand your commands Especially it does not fulfill the requirements to listen old musicSound Quality is goodStruggling how to connect with Bluetooth but yet not successful This means the integration is quite difficult results in no connectivity with BluetoothThis product is somewhat good also bad also because you have to communicate with Alexa by connecting it with plug all timeAnother bad fact is that it uses wifi to workBut it has a clearer and better soundYou can not ask Alexa about your studies as it replies in high standard mannerBut its overall a helping character for meIt doesnt understand what i asked it to do If you give it multiple tasksIt will saySorry i couldnt understand thatAlexa is a growing child and I would like to hold her hand because it is too cuteQ What I like most about AlexaAns Its sound quality and the the glowing lightBonus tip buy it on offers it will be more beneficial for youGifted it to my mother for her birthday this year She’s having a lot of fun discovering so many new features A great way to ease your parents into IoT Pretty good speaker with some smart features I bought this just to connect to my big speaker via Bluetooth and listen to my favourite songs without using my mobile But the sound quality is sop awesome I use it by default by not connecting my big Bluetooth speaker As echo dot has great bass and volumeIt was bought to solve the purpose Purpose solved Was contemplating which version to buy This version is absolutely perfect I have a fire stick and you can easily control the fire stick from the Alexa deviceThe product is good but the biggest disadvantage is that its not a bluetooth speaker Also you cannot control it from mobile You have to think every time give command every time for the song You cannot play any playlist Alexa doesn’t understand every command The sound is good If looking for a speaker this is one of the worst optionsAs a longtime me  having owned several Amazon Echos I can tell you that Alexa is certainly worth it  In years past purchasing an Amazon Echo Is PassionJust Go For ItIts Design is also very UniqueBetter wake up than siri or Google assistantMuch faster nd accurate than otherLoved itSound quality is beyond imaginationIf having no budget issue than go for 4th generation otherwise 3rd generation is also good

integration is still a pain Sometimes doesnt hear us speak Need to talk loud Phone integration is still very bad Took me each time 30 minsCalling Alexa in the early morning instead of calling my wife

sometimes Alex doesnt response properly I have to tell more timesDoesnt recognise and able to find most of the songs even those are exist in Amazon music have to repeat voice commands multiple times

office free time But YouTube was not support and there is no power back up if it Is possible plz change the item to next upgrade with the YouTube support and battry backupProduct is good but pricing is too varied from 1399 to 3499 Beware on price try to check price and wait for right timeVoice command not properly wordtTwo or more times voice command give but wrong workI frastaed with productNot useful speaker Update voice command in gujarati and hindi languagelike everthing from it the voice the commands i gave n it followsGot it For 2200 with wipro Smart led bulb one word to say about this is outstanding  extraordinary from google mini  fantastic The only con of this speaker is Low soundOther things Are Mind BlowingGo for ItHave been using for a monthFacing lot of issuesMic is not sensitive even from few feet away it does not pick voiceAlso when playing aongs on spotify it hets stuck to last played songWe have to reboot it to resume normal functionalityThat product is so good but I dont love that it has a wire how can I carry that with wire but the simple speker are good we can carry thatNo C or D port for power no Bettery inbuilt it cant be moved Not a portable device what I expected  I have return for the same reason  Rest all good But not recommendedI liked this the only prblm was that you have to keep it connected to a power outletwith such small size I found it not worth so instead I exchanged it and bought alexa echo sap which has the power back up of 4 hoursI was expecting more from this given the price of the product the quality of sound is average A bit Disappointed with the productIf you are playing a song in alexa and you want to stop music then you have to manually do this  you can’t interact with it when playing songDrawback that’s why i returned itIts not interesting to my voice in hindi । Its set up are very compeleted। Always its demand hostpot । If u are purchasing this product then u should be keeped two mobile or one router ।then u will be operate। By the way its sound quality is best । One feedback is its always depend on power । Which one more negative to my point of viewWe loved it especially my son👌👌our first smart speakerThere are hell lot of bugs Dont know why people are not talking about it Im not saying its a bad product Its an excellent product But lot of connectivity issues Esp if u use blutooth Sometimes after you connect to bluetooth it stops listening to your commands altogether Then you have to reset the whole device Its a painYou cannot deny that this product is totally worth the money I read 100s of reviews before buying this product just to make sure I am not regretting after my purchaseGood Product But sometimes not finding exact on netVoice recognition should be improved and not recognized

deviceThe media could not be loaded\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0Awesome friend and helper loved it 🤘😍😇I recommend to go for this powerful and smart AI without any hesitantThe media could not be loaded\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0Dont buy Alexa its ease of money even when I tried to refund they said we are not able to reach customer As an independent person they dont let you play regional songsOne of the best purchases in recent times I had some issues while adding wifi but was finally able to connect  Very helpful for kids Got a very good deal during the great Indian festival sale and thanks to GrabOn for the timely alertWorst product I received from amazon it worked well 15 days  stopped working after that when I requested for return Amazon denied it seems seller sent me repaired product  Amazon should banned the sellerThe Alexa is overall a good smart speakerBut at times it has difficulty in processing the voice commandssound output is very goodExcellent packing and easy to setup Item is as described in the product description and works great as expected Sound quality in 3rd generation really cool Overall I am happy with this purchaseit was not taking kannada songs recognisation not worthy compare to google assistant youtube songsnot taking if we say particular song or song artist but it will not show some one especially kannada ppl dntbuy itCant work without powerno battery frequency is not high U can go for better product in this range that can work without powerI usually never review any products but Im so impressed with echo dot Ive been using this for 2 days now and the response is so good I mean Im stilll learning how to teach more skills n all  but Im so  statisfyed with echo dot voice recognition is way better then any voice assistant damn you should buy thisI purchased Alexa last year but now its not working since 6 monthhighly disappointed 😞 sometimes it started working nd suddenly stopped working😞wastage of moneysound is low below expectation the voice recognition is also giving problem the size is very very smallThe media could not be loaded\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0The product is awesome I purchased it for listening to music on the go I really very love the way alexa answers the question Overall loved it☺❤Best prodct ever It came with an adapter and a light bulb It can control even my fire tv stick that i had bought a year ago Not gonna regret buying it as i got it only in ₹2000We require wifi compatible devices I dont have any such devices  so I have to buy additionally Otherwise no use for middle class family Waste of moneyProduct iz good but we cant listen music from utube this iz boring yaarIf u have genuine usage and not just gonna want to go for the trend then only buy it Sound quality isnt as good as expected It seemed poorer than a normal speaker Not that great usage or quality as I have heard it to beOverall ok Cannot able to integrate android tv Expecting tamil skills hope it will be deployed soon Big drawback is voice recognition when you closer and louder alexa able to recognize youNot useful better to buy a Bluetooth speakerVery useful Device with home applianceGifted to my niece  She is fascinated with the product As Through AI it replies to our questionsYou need to get subscription of all services  Without that this cant even play a song  Cant connect or call to your Indian contacts  Only us numbers are valid for AlexaEverything looks amazing except when you try to use Alexa as a bluetooth speaker for your phone and laptop It really struggles to play sound from mobile and laptopsIn short Amazon needs to improve the quality of the bluetooth they are using within Echo devicesIt served my purpose needed bluetooth device and I got voice command based as add on But still need to improve with voice recognition and desired resultJust buy it Its worth evwry penny No ome will be bored again Very good sound for such a small packageAlexa is good listens to my all commands and does things perfectly My kids keeps her very busy I gave only 4 stars and deducted 1 star because for one con which I feltAtleast they should have given an in build nasty back up which works for atleast 3 hrs Continuous power supply is neededThe product being so compact but still sounding soo much good is the best thing in itselfIf you are thinking about a speaker with a good sound for a room and you want some smart functionalities with it go for the Alexa Its really awesome and do consider buying smart bulb after you purchase AlexaIts artificial intelligence is awesome recognise almost everything in English and Hindi languageSpeaker as such excellent However alexa voice command is useful only when you have those many devicesIts been few hours though but I am already impressed by the echo dot and the Wipro led both and the integration between the two is good but I am not sure if I can change the color variants of the led through Alexa or not rest all is fine for me worth for money in the saleI just love the productVoice recognition is really awesome n i just love the sound quality its fun as well as easy to use alexa m using it frm past 2years n  this time I

understanding could get better And if Alexa cant understand what device you are talking about it would be better if it stops saying did you mean TVAlexa is good value for money and fun to use When using in India make sure u select English India as language so that it can relate to our conversations and media contentMany times I have to try to install in my phone but not connected I dont know why this happened please help me otherwise I will return this itemThe claims of the advt about the product is baseless I cannot add the device to Android phone despite repeated attempts for two days It is a useless product and a pure waste of moneyAlexq 3rd gen smart speaker is goodThere is a slight delay in recognizing voiceotherwise its a good product Thank you amazonhoped that will be fixed in the future updateThe voice recognition is so poor most of the times and its not even listening and playing irrelevant songs rather than the asked oneand every time the sound goes low What the f is this Not complete music play and needs to tell the song and singer to select one song very less information can work only what available on wiki and amazon music kids rhymes are also limitedI am happy with the product If you have amazon subscription and a stable wifi then it is recommended to choose this product  I liked this It doesnt have batterybackup It requires plugged in all the timeIts  likely good but it has no battery so other than that its a great experience over alexaIntial 10days the device was alright and working ok whereas from the 11th day it started having problem like it starts making beep noice while the music is playing and i am not able to return the device as they have given 10days time for the return So Amazon help me with thisEverything is perfect I have

pleasureSometimes alexa doesnt understand what is asked and interpretsaomething else It doesnt even understand a few Indian namesA value of money product This is the third one I broughtLikes  Identification of Voice despite of background noise Learning platform for Kids  StudentsDislikes  Can not play Amazon Prime Music Which is bundled FREE anlong with Echo Dot 3 Suddenly stops responding

phone but eventually everything got intact and everything was just perfect I love it❤️❤️Very usefullGood sound quality it recognise voice well but the algorithm which was implemented in the device only in that way we need to ask the questions other waise it will not understand the commandExcept that everything is too goodDo not buy any alexa enabled device you cannot setup multiple account

knowledgeable as compared to Google She doesnt know many thingsA very gift good for any age wish Gujarati language option is available Although combination of English and Hindi is an option so no issue for non English speakers Very nice passtime for seniors Wish Amazon makes it to work while unpluggedIt is the most useful item it handles all my reminders alarms shopping lists and even play songs for me as per my likes found it quite convinient as it makes living simple and organized Absolutely loved the way Alexa manages it all for me❤️Seems to be a new member added to our family keeping kids busy However she hangs up at times failing to resolve the requests which I guess needs some fine tuningA nice product from amazon works fine  Voice recognition is good still hope it

network of this device it start working and it was not able to connect and this sucksYes it is most popular but it doesnt have any use except listening songs cause it doesnt know any more information about most of the things same if you search on google it has every single informationAlexa speaker is Good But Alexa Android application is not good Alexa listening skill is also not so accurateThe product is really good Lesser skills on Alexa should improve on the quality and innovations in the Alexa skills Sounds awesome and the setup takes a bit more time than expected even with good internet connectivity And unnecessary notifications and cant handle multiple tasks at onceOver all performance is vary satisfying It almost understands every thing I say Its best for small roomIts working good but it cant to be used in outside If u want to use it u will definitely connect to u r connecter and we couldnt connect with u r mobile data You will connect with wifi onlyIn the beginning I could not

amazing product with amazing features apart from this sound is really good Very good for kids as well Simply paisa wusoolWe are very glad to bring alexa at home Its like a new family member who always listen and help us entertain us as well as control our smart devices smartlyAmazing product with good sound quality and clarity Easy to configure and usea very BAD Quality product supplied I am highly disappointed Most of the time its doesnt work very poor connectivity and also sound quality is very bad  blurr  How can such bad quality products can be supplied here on AmazonVery bad product worst product i bought in my life worst is it dont have youtube music in itamazon and spotify cant play good music as youtubeI ordered two Echo Dots I got them delivered on time however there was no device and its power adapter in one of the boxes I hope that a replacement will be arranged soonCompared to google it’s not that good Sounds quality and assistant reply and clarity is better in google mini then echo 3rd genWriting review after using 6 months its the best thing Ive ever purchased on Amazon its performance is the same after using it for 6 months  Total use of money Voice recognition is good Alexa is super smart kids will definitely love itLove this product AmazingThank u AmazonIntelligent control of my wipro smart bulbI got the product combo with a great deal RS 1999😍😍😍Alexa program searching quality is not very fast or I can say not very clever some perticular in old singers or Gazals singers or devotional songs in all religionsNot happy with the product Local FM tuning is not possible YouTube connectivity is not possible without subscription to red Playing music from integrated device is also not possible Very unhappyEvery time it is giving an error while connecting and also it is not playing original songs rather playing mashups Not worth it Google mini is far better than Alexa Gooing for refundThis is i want from long time but its price always high so waiting but now its in my hand and doing it job coolSound quality excellentSetup is difficult by selecting wifiBuy during sale will be good optionBest thing  i took for my daughters birthdayAll t happy with AlexaVery good productAwesome product  does what it saysIts does not understand the wordsthat we are saying for example if we ask for a song which available in amazon music its does pick alsoIt’s not connecting to required firetv but to some other firetv using same account though names are different two firetvsThe speakers would vibrate like an old gramophone rather than that it was an absolute masterpiece for a smart homeThank you amazon for taking back the product and refunding the amount within 4 hours of package pickupIt picks up accent fast my son asked to play DJ wale babu song first time it replied ok playing DJ vale babubut after 3rd time it correctly pronunced it as wale was really quick at picking it up Microphone is quite good overall a good productSound quality is really nice sometimes she takes time to listen to me other than that the built quality and everything is good at this rangeThe product is not in the courier only fire stick and wipro bulp only received Insted of echo dot I have received un ordered ladies hand bagSound is good and voice recognition is also good Connected with amazon prime music Also got smart bulb connected to itThe media could not be loaded\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0I brought it in prime sale 2 months ago Sounda gone crazy totally brokencustomer service is not avilableIts really nice toy to play with Tech geeks should must buy this I recommend spending Rs 2100 on echo dot than Bluetooth speakersIt delivers as described by amazon Not as good due to lack of google integration but still its fun to have an echo deviceExcellentIt picks different songs I want a song but it playsSong with nearby name or different language some timesWhenever the volume is fullwe literally have to shout to make her listen to our voice Pathetic Bluetooth connectivity is very poor Automatically gets disconnected again n againThe media could not be loaded\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0world best speaker I have ever taken you should take it I will highly recommend and the best thing is that we can set commands and reply of the commands through app of Alexa I love AlexaGood to have when feeling aloneI am very much satisfied with this product Mostly we are using it to listen to songs but also at times for getting certain information As it has a aux output slot I could connect it to my music system which gives an enhanced listening experienceYou have no clue what value it can add Spend some time and then you will get used to it as your companion 🤠Just works  Can play a lot of music  Not always the best at voice recognition but still It worksAlexa is a problem as there are times when she doesnt respond to instructionsOn the initial day of set up she kept making a mistake and was not recognising our voice I didnt expect this from AlexaNot recognizing voice always difficulty with pluginSound quality low overall product is goodThe product is not good compared to Google mini no much sing collection in amazon musicthe listening time is very less most of the time it will start searching before we completes our sentenceIt was okBuilt quality not upto the mark Power adapter failed in 2 months Now new Dapter cost Rs1999 which is very close to entire cost of Echo dotVery good product at an affordable price Recongnises the voice of all Has wide variety of usageThis is first experience with smart speakerI live the echo dot❤️It Pauses frequently Takes command with difficultyHardware aspect is awesome  Amazon need to look in for better skills  Overall good oneIt’s great  very exciting to be

it starts with the same songGoogle Home Mini understands everything better than this ALEXABut I Like ALEXA Voice QualityMy Favorite is Google Home MiniThis is my first smart device and it works great I have no complaints  Works well with the smart bulbsSetup was incredibly simple and easy It has a good sound quality and easily recognizes voice commandsFaced some difficulties with connecting to internet initially Got prompt assistance from Amazon So far working fine Good oneGood voice recognition nd sounds qualityAmazing product… essy to use… must buyIf you are buying it for listening music its good Very less web coverage But nothing that cant be fixed with an software updateGood productI created voice profile for myself only on it but it also recognises and execute commands given by others as wellIts a must have product for your kids they will love and enjoy Alexa servicesThe product is awesome but there is no battery so i bit no more satisfying otherwise the sound is excellent

its paisa wasoolIts totally awesome paisa wasoolsound quality is very amazing on this new echo dot3can also connect to Bluetooth and play a mobile song in AlexaI just love itNot portable at all Required all time chargingNot user friendlyAmazing to use it with smart bulbs and other automation utilities but in terms of playing music its lacking the punch and the audio quality at the priceIts a great productI said alexa pani pilade she said khud uthke lwle So i slapped alexa because batameezi She broke down Cant even hit kids these daysQuality is not good Sound is irritating when keep on full volumeThis best part of Alexa is she can hear on low tone Just say Alexa and she is good to go on all your commands Never aspect this type AI is provided by Amazon I am very happy with my purchase Totally worth itAwesome productMy kids very much like and lean about new thingsThisproduct i received is not working wellI want to exchange itI was using Google crome and It better compare to AlexaIts really good product My child like it too much  Working perfectly initially got dificulty for settings but with the help of YouTube connect with wifi100 satisfied with this dealIts an good one  Go for it Good one for an gift  Works as specified but with Speakers like Bose theres more to be done by introduction of Skills by Devices integratedAwesomeGreat voice recognition and very portable Helpful in listening to favorite music Alarm Etc Love itSound quality is good but Alexa AI integration is not that powerful It’s doesn’t know many of the answers If comparing with Google Home Mini built quality and sound quality and mic of Alexa is better but when it comes to the software Alexa stands no whereIts working good I am so happy for this productThis product is not suitable for those who have only android mobiles it is good for smart gaskets in homenice to have it specially for babies who always looking for mobile or tvSound quality is good but when it comes to tune in radio that alexa is blank and even alexa is only supported for amazon music or few channels  If you are thinking favourite music its very hard to find in alexai using this product last one month is is very good
